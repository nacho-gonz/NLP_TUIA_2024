(Modules from both Goodie Boxes may be used.) \u25cf Give it its 3 workers, its Kali Statue, 3 Money, 0 Fame, and the first player marker. \u25cf Do not give the bot a Province board, nor any dice or Yield tokens. \u25cf ( Download and print the Fate Deck ) Shuffle its Fate Deck and place it face up, showing the action space side. ON THE BOT\u2019S TURN \u25cf At the start of its turn, flip over the top card of the Fate Deck and place it to the right of the deck, forming a discard pile. The card on top of the Fate Deck is called the Active Card and shows which action spaces it could go to. The card on top of the discard pile is called the Choice Card and will show the choice/action to be made. \u25cf Arrows will lead from the Active Card and point to the Choice Card to indicate the choice being made. If a decision arrow requires another card to be flipped (Quarry and Market), take the next card down from under the Active Card and flip it over and to the right of the current Choice Card, returning the current Active Card back to the top of the Fate Deck. \u25cf If the resulting decision is invalid because the space has been taken, gather all Choice Cards to the top of the discard pile if needed, then flip over a new card from the Fate Deck to reveal new Active and Choice Cards to repeat the process. \u25cf Once a valid space has been established, move one of the bot\u2019s workers to that space and execute the action associated with both the space and with the choice that was made as indicated on the Choice Card(s). If there are multiple spots available (River, Quarry, etc.) it will choose the cheapest space. The bot never pays for action spaces. \u25cf Once finished completing its actions, gather all Choice Cards to the top of the discard pile if needed, then play passes to you and continues. THE SPECIAL FATE CARD As the Active Card: \u25cf Place the bot\u2019s worker in the Mango Village. \u25cf If it is occupied or you are not playing with the Mango Village module, follow the arrow.", "If the choice is a Tiger: Roads of the Mogul Empire. If it is a Cow: Kedarnath Temple. \u25cf If the choice is a module you are not playing with, the spaces are occupied, or it is a Snake, place the worker on the Outer Terrace (the 2 Money and reroll space), if able. As the Choice Card: \u25cf Take the current Active Card and use its own backing as its Choice Card for that turn. Flip it over and place it to the right of the Special Fate Card. It is still the Active Card . \u25cf If further cards are needed to be drawn (Quarry and Market choices) take and flip the top card of the Fate Deck to finish the choice. \u25cf Once the turn is finished, you must gather ALL cards, shuffle, and reset the Fate Deck. THE BOT\u2019S ACTIONS After placing its worker, it resolves actions of the location like a player would. **VERY IMPORTANT - If the bot ever ends its turn without gaining any Money or Fame, it will gain 2 Fame.** Money - The bot receives Money as normal. Fame - The bot receives Fame as normal. Dice - It never collects or manipulates dice. It gains 1 Money per die it is to receive. River movement - Move the bot\u2019s boat as normal, resolving the river space. Gaining Workers - The bot will gain additional workers as normal. First Player - The bot will gain the First Player Token as normal. Karma - If the bot already has 3 Karma and it is to gain more, the bot will then lose 1 Karma for each Karma that is to be gained. Otherwise, the bot gains Karma normally. Upgrades - The bot will make upgrades with the following priorities: It will upgrade the temple with its token that is furthest to the left, breaking further ties with the temple order from top to bottom (White, Yellow, Red, Brown). Yield Tokens - The bot will only be allowed to take 4 Yield Tokens total for the entire game. When gaining its first token, it will take a random White Yield. The second token will be Yellow. The third will be Red. The fourth and final will be Brown. Place the tokens along the right side of its Kali statue in the dice slots from top to bottom. When all 4 slots have been filled, it will not gain any more.", "It also can gain Yield Tokens as a player would, when it has fewer workers to place than you do in a round. Markets - Resolve the action by assessing the Markets on the bot\u2019s collected Province Tiles. It always scores the most markets it can, as if the die it would have given up was \u2018infinity\u2019. The bot will still go to a Market stall even if it has no corresponding Markets in its supply. River Spots - It resolves river spaces normally, and for spaces that assess collected Karma, Markets, Upgrades, or Province Tiles, assess the bot\u2019s own collection. When deciding which Chamber action to execute, use the current Choice Card. If it shows the \u20181\u2019, flip over cards from the Fate Deck until a valid choice is made. For the space that grants up to 3 river movements, use the current Choice Card. For the space that scores a Province Tile again, choose the best one. For the space that assesses collected different color dice, the bot has none . The Dolphin is resolved by finding the 2 numbers in the top corners of the current Active and Choice Cards. Add them together and count that many spaces starting from the Dolphin (wrapping back to the start if needed) then resolve that space. The only river space action it does not execute is the \u2018return and place a worker\u2019 space.Province Tiles - When taking and scoring a regular Province tile or a Mango tile, it will resolve the reward as normal, but for the Snake, Tiger, and Cow Module tiles, ignore all rewards and benefits. Then after resolving any tile, in addition if it has any Yield Tokens, it will score and resolve those as well.", "Its Yield Tokens will be scored multiple times throughout the game as a result. Master Builder - Use the previous Choice Card from the discard pile to choose the tile to take. Do not score its Yield Tokens when scoring the tile, just as the space indicates. MODULES Mango Village - The bot will always take the tile furthest from the stack and resolve its reward. Shift the unchosen tile away from the stack and refill the space with a new tile. Remember to score all of its Yield Tokens, as mentioned before.", "Kedarnath Temple - The bot will always choose the bottom-most available benefit to resolve. Roads of the Mogul Empire - If there are flags available, it takes one and gains 1 Fame. Resolve the space by assessing its collected Province Tiles, treating them all as placed next to the Residence (*max 3*). Gemstone Trader - When the bot collects it, remove it from the game and it gains 1 Fame. Holi Festival - Resolve the tile normally when triggered. If the bot is choosing between dice, use the current Choice Card to determine which color to take, then it discards the die. If the bot is the one to trigger the festival, it takes the token and gains 1 Fame. Pink Elephant - If the bot goes to the Outer Terrace, it takes the Elephant and gains 1 Fame. Test of Fate - Resolve it normally, assessing the bot\u2019s collection of Province Tiles. Use the current Choice Card when deciding which tile to take, or flip over cards from the Fate Deck until there is a valid choice. END GAME The game ends and is resolved in the normal way. ADJUSTING DIFFICULTY To make the game more difficult, experiment with some or all of the following: \u25cf Give it a 3 coin White Yield Token during setup. \u25cf When it takes White, Yellow, and Red Yield Tokens, it takes only those showing Money. \u25cf When it goes to the Market, choose the space that would score it the most points, rather than what the Choice Card says. \u25cf When it gains its Gemstone Jeweler or a Flag from the Roads of the Mogul Empire, give it 2 Fame instead of 1. \u25cf When it goes to the Quarry, take the best scoring tile for the bot. \u25cf When resolving the Dolphin river space, choose the highest scoring space for the bot.", "Rajas of the Ganges - Solo version The only thing needed for this solo version of Rajas of the Ganges is a D6 (fortunately there are plenty of these in the box), so you can start right now to play your first solo game. For the human player all game rules apply as normal, so the game is a lot like if you were playi ng a multiplayer game.", "The other player(s) will be simulated by dummy players that hopefully behave a lot like humans would do: Aiming for the target t o fulfill the win condition first, but still being unpredictably sometimes. Before setting up the game, choose your variant of the game from the rulebook as usual. This solo version can be played with any combination of the base rules, the Navaratnas version and the Ganga module . Then choose how many players you want to simulate and bring up the accor ding side of the board. Use the cover tiles for the 3 player game, if you are p laying with 2 dummies. Setup Set up the board and the province tiles in the usua l way according to the variant you are going to play. Set up your own playing mate rial as in a usual multiplayer game and take the elephant . You always are the starting player. Set up each dummy player in the following way: Usual setup: \u2022Place 3 of the workers on the according bonus field s on the tracks \u2022The other 3 workers are already available \u2022Place the boat at the start of the river \u2022Place an upgrade cube on value 2 of each building d evelopment scroll \u2022Place the fame marker on space 0 of the fame track \u2022Place the money marker on space 4 of the money trac k (default position for 2nd player in turn order. 3rd and 4th start wit h 5 and 6 money) \u2022Place one die of each color near his available work ers, each die showing 6 pips Differences to human players: \u2022No Kali statue \u2022No karma cube \u2022No money track bonus marker \u2022Dice are not rolled Page 1End of game & Setting the difficulty After the setup you will play the game in the usual way, thinking about and taking your turns as normally.", "Whenever it is the t urn of a dummy player, he also will take his turn by placing a worker and exe cuting the resulting actions, just like a human player.", "To determine the action t aken by a dummy player, a D6 is rolled. If it is the dummy player's turn and he has no workers left, he skips his turn, just as a human player would do. If you or a dummy player reach the end condition of Rajas of the Ganges (fame marker and money marker converge or pass each other), finish the game in the usual way and determine the winner. Measuring performance If you want to have a closer look at your performan ce, I recommend you to count the rounds of play to get a result like 'Fini shed the game with the 3rd worker of round 7'. (You can use dice to do this, p lace one of them showing a 1 beside the board and wind it up each time you are c ollecting the workers from the board.", "You probably will need a second die for counting rounds 7-12). Increasing difficulty If you want a harder game by increasing the win cha nce of the dummy players, choose your handicap number (e.g. 5) and move the d ummy player's fame marker forward by this number (-> 5 spaces) and mov e the dummy player's money marker forward by twice this number (-> 10 sp aces) right after setting up the game. Grant him all the bonuses his markers pass (-> the upgrade from the fame track and the 1 river movement from the mo ney track). Dummy player general rules To ease the handling of the dummy player, some gene ral simplifications are made: \u2022The dummy player has no dice limit (no Kali statue needed). \u2022All the dice the dummy player has always have the correct number of pips that are needed for a corresponding action. Handle them as if he could choose the value of a die any time he wants t o. \u2022Because of this, a dummy player does not need to spend karma (no karma marker needed). When karma is needed to deter mine a number for a bonus he receives, he always has 3 karma (so he g ets 3 dice on the corresponding river fields). \u2022If a dummy player earns karma , he earns the same of amount of money instead. Page 2\u2022The dummy player's money marker never moves back . He never has to spend money for using action fields. This is why he does not need the money track bonus marker, although he receives all bonuses he passes over. \u2022The dummy player has no province board . So he never can get a bonus by connecting a border to his palace. He just colle cts the province tiles he buys in loose order. \u2022He receives fame for placing tiles with buildings and receives money for placing tiles with markets as normal at the moment he buys the tile (remember to check the upgrade marker of the corres ponding building to award the correct amount of fame). \u2022Markets are gathered as normal and take effect when the market place action is used. The tiles just are not placed on a province board. Dummy player turn Choosing the main area The action the dummy player takes will be determine d mainly randomly by the roll of a D6. Take a look at the main board to identify the 6 main areas there: (1) The chambers (Upper area of the palace, where the 6 people are) (2) The quarry (Area where province tiles are bought) (3) The market place (Area where you get money according to the markets you have built) (4) The harbor (Area where you move your boat up the Ganges) (5) The balconies (Area where you trade one die for 2 dice of a cert ain color) (6) The terrace (Area where you just take 1 die of a certain color ) Use the result of the D6 and check if that main are a is generally valid for placing the dummy player's worker there. If the result is not valid, re-roll the D6 until a valid result is determined.", "The same applies for all following steps where a non-valid result is rolled: Re-roll until a valid result has been determined. \u2022Of course a main area without any free worker posit ion is not valid. \u2022The dummy player has to spend his dice as a human player does. So if he has no die and rolls the number of an area where a die has to be spend (1, 2, 4, 5 and 3 if he can't use one of the action spa ces where no die has to be spent (see details in the next chapter), this main area is not valid Page 3\u2022The quarry (2) is not valid, if the dummy player ca n not buy any of the available province tiles. As all of his dice have t he value 6, this only should be the case if he does not have any die or s ome of the piles have already been used up. \u2022The market place (3) is not valid, if the dummy pla yer has no market on his built province tiles. It also is not valid if a die must be spend (because all of the lower fields are already taken) and the dummy has no die. \u2022The harbor (4) is not valid if the dummy player's b oat already has reached the end of the Ganges \u2022IMPORTANT RULE: The balconies (5) and the terrace (6) are not valid, if the dummy player already has 5 or more dice . In this case (a 5 or 6 is rolled when choosing the main area and the dummy has at least 5 dice) the dummy player chooses the quarry as main area instead (as if the roll had been a (2)) and spends one or more of his dice on province tiles there. This rule prevents the dummy from collecting an end less number of dice and makes him act much more like a human player. Choosing a detail action in that main area The first roll of the D6 determines which of the ma in areas is chosen. Depending on the area a detail decision has to be made. This often requires the roll of a second D6 and sometimesrequires a decisio n regarding which die color or province tile shall be taken or spent. Aft er choosing the detail action, place the dummy player's worker on the according ac tion space. When going to the quarry (2) or the harbor (4), al ways use the action space with the lowest amount of money, but don't pay it (remember \"Dummy player general rules\"). (1) The chambers Roll another D6 to determine a free and valid actio n space (again, re-roll until a valid space is determined). Put the worker there. S pend a die (see the \"Dummy player decisions\" section below to determine which die color to spend) to pay the cost. Perform the action: (1) Dummy gets 2 fame and will be starting player n ext round. (2) Dummy gets two dice (see \"Dummy player decision s\" for colors) and a white yield tile. He directly claims the bonus from the tile. (3) Dummy gets 2 money (instead of karma, see \"Dumm y player general rules\") and a die (see \"Dummy player decisions\" for color). Page 4(4) Dummy performs an upgrade (see \"Dummy player de cisions\") and gets 3 money. (5) Only valid if dummy has at least one province t ile without a market. Dummy replaces one of his province tiles (see \"Dumm y player decisions\"). (6) Only valid if dummy still can move 6 river spac es. Dummy performs the move and claims the bonus. (2) The quarry Use the action space with the lowest amount of mone y to place the worker, but don't pay the money. Decide which province tile to buy (see \"Dummy player decisions\"), spend the dice and take the province t ile. Immediately award the fame for the buildings on it (remember to check the cor responding upgrade track) and the money for markets on it. (3) The market place Use an action field that does not require a die and grants money for different markets, if it is available. Otherwise choose the f ree action field that grants the most money to the dummy player. Put a worker there. Decide whi ch die to spend (see \"Dummy player decisions\") and collect th e money on the money track. (4) The harbor Use the action space with the lowest amount of mone y to place the worker, but don't pay the money. Roll another D6 to determine how many river steps are taken: (1), (2): 1 step (3), (4): 2 steps (5), (6): 3 steps Decide which die to spend (see \"Dummy player decisi ons\"), perform the move and award the bonus of the target river field. (5) The balconies Decide which die to spend (see \"Dummy player decisi ons\") among the available fields, place the worker and collect the dice in the other color. (6) The terrace Roll a D6 to determine whether to take a die or 2 m oney, if the re-roll field is still available. Only on a (6) choose to take the money. The dummy p layer does not re-roll his dice. On (1)-(5) decide which die to get (see \"Dummy play er decisions\") among the available fields, place the worker and collect the die in the chosen color. Page 5Dummy player decisions Sometimes the dummy player has to make decisions ab out which dice to take or to spend. As this game is mainly about taking provi nce tiles and most of the tiles can be bought with two dice of the same color , the dummy player tries to collect two dice per color . This basic rule leads to the following behaviour: \u2022Priorities when choosing the color for taking a die : 1. A color he already has exactly 1 die of 2. A color he currently has no die of 3. The color he has the least die of Whenever a tie occurs in any decision, this is brok en randomly. Example : Dummy has 1 green and 1 purple and earns a die -> Because of 1. he takes green or purple and not blue or orange. Do a random decision (e.g. by rolling a die) to determine if he gets a g reen or a purple die. Example 2 : Dummy has 3 green, 2 blue and 2 orange dice -> Be cause priority 1. does not match, he takes a purple die b y evaluating priority 2. Example 3 : Dummy has 3 green, 2 blue, 2 orange dice and 4 p urple dice -> Random decision between blue and orange because of priority 3. \u2022Priorities when choosing the color for spending a die (for other things than buying a province tile): 1. A color he has 3 or more dice of 2.", "A color he has 1 die of 3. A color he has 2 dice of \u2022Priorities when choosing the type of building for performing an upgrade (The dummy player always tries to max out the trac ks): 1. A track his marker is at 3 2. A track his marker is at 2 When buying a province tile with the quarry action , the dummy player tries to spend a pair of same-colored dice to buy a province tile from the 7-10 price range. \u2022When buying a province tile : 1. Choose the die color he has the most dice of 2. If possible, spend 2 dice of that color 3. In the resulting price range of the determined c olor randomly determine which tile to buy Page 6\u2022When replacing a province tile with the master builder action (person 5 in the chambers), the dummy player tries to spend e xactly one more die: 1. Choose the die color from the 3 \u2013 1 \u2013 2 schema (see \" Choosing the color for spending a die \") 2. As tile to replace, choose the most expensive th at has no market on it 3. In the resulting price range of the determined c olor randomly determine which tile to buy by Dennis Beck (BGG: Joellenbecker) Good luck and have fun!

The player with the highest different is the winner.", "Setup: 1. Place the Game Board in the middle of the table, the correct side up for the number of player (2P or 3/4P). In a 3P game only, cover the rightmost \u201c1 \u201d Harbour space, and the left most \u201c1\u201d quarry space with the Cover T iles. 2. Make a supply of all 48 Dice next to the board. 3. Sort the 64 Provi nce T iles into 16 of each colour ( O, G, B, P), then sort the tiles of each colour into piles by their backs (snake, cow, tiger). This produces 12 stacks . Shuffle each stack, and them next to the Game Board face up. 4. Shuffle the 8 Yield Tiles (white) and place them in a face down stack on the Temple. (Ignore the other Yield tiles). 5. Give each player a Province Board (place this basic side up) , and the following components in their colour: a. 1 Kali Statue Board (put in fron t of the player with the 10 handed side showing) , b. 6 Workers (put 3 on the applicable spaces of the record tracks , and 3 below the Kali Statue Board ), c. 1 Boat (put on the start space on the river) , d. 5 Cubes (1 on lv l 1 of the Karma Track, put 1 on the first column of each of the four Building Devt scrolls) , e. 1 Money Marker (octagon , see later for placement) , f. 1 Fame Marker (shield, put on space 0 of the Fame Track) g. 1 Bonus Marker (Put on space 12 of the Money Track, river side up ). 6. Each player takes 1 Die of each colour (O, G, B, P), rolls them, and places each on one of the Kali Statue hands . 7. The player who rolled the lowest total result is the Start P layer (if there is a tie, the player who most recently ate Indian food breaks the tie). The Start Player takes the Elephant and puts it next to his Kali Statue. He puts his money marker on space 3 of the Money Track. P2/P3/P4 (clockwise) get 4/5/6 money, and so on until all players have placed their Money Markers. Course of the Game : The game proceeds over several rounds. Eac h round consists of several stages. In each stage, each player will place one Worker in a vacant space, and take the associated action . This continues until no player can place a worker. At the end of the round, players retrieve their workers, and play pro ceeds to the next round. Workers can be placed on the following areas of the Game Board : Quarry, Marketplace, Palace, Harbour . Placing workers and doing actions : When a player places a worker, they must immediately pay any costs (depicted on the space they chose \u2013 money or dice), and then they carry out the action. Note: \u2022 Each action space can only hold one worker , and dice are never placed on action spaces. \u2022 When money is paid , your money marker goes backwards on the money track that number of steps \u2013 you cannot select a space you cannot afford. \u2022 When money is gained , your m oney marker goes forward that number of steps . \u2022 When dice are paid , they are returned to supply: if you don\u2019t have the required die, again, you can \u2019t do the action. \u2022 When dice are gained , they take that die from the bank and roll it , before adding it to their Kali Statue. A player can only store as many dice as Kali has hands. If a player would receive more dice than Kali has hands, the y either return dice they already have from Kali before the roll the new ones or take only the dice that will fit. If there is no die of the required colour in the bank, it cannot be taken. If a player receives multiple dice, they roll them all together. Action 1: Building Action (at the Quarry) : To develop your Province, you need to send workers to the Quarry. Pay 1 -4 money (depending on the space chosen), and return to supply a minimum of the pip value in dice of the correct colour for the tile you wish to acquire (from your Kali statue) . A player may over -pay pips but receives no change . Take exactly one Province tile from the display of 12. The purchased tile must be immediately placed in your province : \u2022 The newly placed tile must connect by road to your residence (top centre of your province). \u2022 A tile may be turned in any orientation and may cut off an already existing road (provided at least one road runs to your residence). Once placed, a tile remains i n place for the rest of the game. \u2022 A tile placement may produce a \u2018 Special Yield \u2019. o On the edges of your province board there are yields, which a player receives immediately if they connect a road to it ( after they have scored the province tile itself). o A player can choose to (or may be forced to) not connect to the yield if the tile they place does not have enough roads of the right orientation : they miss this yield . o NB: The bottom middle tile printed in your province is 3 dead ends \u2013 you cannot connect through it. When a tile is added to your p rovince, you immediately gain Money/F ame for it . Money: If the tile has Markets , you score the amount of money printed on the tile. Fame: When you add a tile with Buildings on it, immediately receive the amount of Fame equal to your upgrade cube\u2019s position on that Build ing\u2019s Scroll , for each Building . The plans for the 4 types of buildings can be upgraded (to increase the fame produced) by taking an action with the | -> icon . These upgrades don\u2019t affect Buildings already placed in your Province. Action 2: Market Action (at the Market Place) : Each time you send a Worker to one of the Market Spaces, you generate money from the Markets in your province . There are three types of Goods on your Province Tiles : Silk, Tea, and Spices (with a money value). There are two types of Market Spaces at the Market Place that allow you to gain money for the goods you have : In a 3/4 P game, you may only place 1 Worker in each of the Assorted Goods and Goods of one Type spaces. \u2022 Assorted Goods : Place a worker , gain Money for exactly one market per type of good , i.e. a maximum of one Silk, and one Tea, and one Spice Market. \u2022 Goods of one Type : Place a worker , AND give up any one die . Then you may gain Money for up to a maximum of as many markets of one kind as the value of the die ). e.g. with a 2 pip die you can gain money from up to two of your spice markets. Action 3: Palace Actions : Give up a die (options 3 & 4 only ), and receive a benefit . Spaces as follows : 1. Outer Terrace: (No die cost ) Take 2 Money . Re-roll as many of your dice as you want . This could include dice you gained for reaching spaces 12/44 on the Money Track by taking the 2 Money. 2. Terrace: (No die cost ) Take 1 Die of the colour next to the space you chose . 3. Balconies: Pay 1 die of any value of the required colour . Roll and gain 2 dice of the specified new colour . 4. The Chambers: Give up 1 die of the specified number and receive a benefit: a.

Appendix 1: Navaratnas Version: Use all 6 Workers, Kali has only 8 Dice Spaces, Upgraded special yield tiles Flip your province tile to the back -side. The yields at the province edges are less powerful, but can be upgraded with yield tiles.", "At the start of the game, shuffle the brown yield tiles and deal one to each player. They put that tile on one of the two possib le spaces (covering up a minor yield). Place the remaining brown yield tiles, and all other yield tiles face up on the corresponding building plan of the same colour. There are 2 ways to get these yield tiles: 1. When you are the dancer . When you take the rol e of the dancer, take a yield tile of your choice. Instead of getting its bonus now, immediately place it on one of the yield spaces of the corresponding colour on your province. You receive its bonus when you connect to the yield. 2. When you have fewer act ive workers than the other players. If at least one other player has more workers than you do, when it comes your turn to take an action, but you can\u2019t (due to having used your workers already), instead take a yield tile and place it on a yield space on yo ur board (colour must match as normal). This means that a round is always played to give everyone an equal number of turns \u2013 either they use a worker, or they take a Yield Tile. If you are two workers behind another player you would get and place a yield t ile each time you would have played a worker. The Navaratn as Version can also be used to handicap experienced players versus inexperienced players playing the basic version. If doing this, all players can only have 5 workers, the Y/R/B yield tiles stay in the box, and play the white yield tiles as per the basic version. Appendix 2: The Ganga Module: Modify the river spaces by covering them in river tiles. Get the 8 River Tiles out of the box, and randomise them face down.

See below for details on the Navaratnas Version and the Ganga Module (2 variants to the game!)  Sort the \u201cProvince Tiles\u201d by colo r, and then by the 3 different a nimal ba cks (snake, cow, tiger). o Place the 12 stacks face -down next to the board, then flip the top tile of each stack face -up.

Game Flow :  Rajas of the Gan ges is played over a number of rounds until 1 player triggers the end of the game by having their Fame and Money marker intersect paths. At this point, remaining players in turn order will have 1 more turn before the end. The winning player will be whoe ver was able to move their markers past each other the furthest (in case multiple players achieve t his goal during the last turn.)  During a round, starting with the 1st player going clockwise, each player will place 1 worker into 1 of the many empty action spaces and carry out the given action before the next player\u2019 s turn. When all players are out of workers, the round ends. General Rules to get Started :  As stated above, on a players turn, they w ill place one of their workers o nto an empty action space a nd take the action. There are 4 different areas of the board (Quarry, Market, Harbor, Palace ) where players can place workers (see below for detailed descriptions of each action area )  Some of the action spaces have a cost associated with them when you plac e your worker there . o If the space in the center of the action space is empty, it\u2019s free! o If the space shows a coin value, pay it (move marker backwards. ) o If the space shows a di e, return the indicated die (color and pip value might matter.)  Pip-less die mean \u201cany value ,\u201d and a Tan die mean \u201cany color\u201d  Anytime in the game you earn Fame or money, you move your marker immediately (earning any bonus es on the track as you go,) and whe n you earn dice (if any remain of that color ,) roll the dice immediately and place on your Kali Statue. o Your Kali Statue holds 10 dice. If you were to take an 11th, you can refuse it or replace 1 on the Statue already . Karma \u2013 Is a resource earned throughout the game that is tracked above the Palace on the upper left side of the b oard. o It allows a player (at anytime on their turn) to flip 1 die to the opposite side by sliding your cube down 1 space. o You can spend as many Karma points as you want on your turn. The max to hold at 1 time is 3 (see track .)  New Workers \u2013 As the game progresses, you will be moving your money, fame and boat markers along their respective paths. If you reach the space with 1 of your workers , you take it and immediately add it to your pool, ready to work! Once you receive your 5th worker, the 6th worker still on the board is removed to the box. Only 5 can be earned in total . Scoring Track Bonuses \u2013 Along the Fame and Money track, you will earn rewards when you reach certain numbers. o Since you can only go forward on the Fame track, the rewards are simply printed on the board for when you reach them, you earn them. They are spaces 5, 24 and 31. o The Money track is different as there is a small token you will use. You see, since your money can go up and down, the designers made it easy to remember if you go t the bonus yet or not. The first time you cross this bonus marker, take the reward, flip the token, and move it up to the next space that matches this bonus token. The spaces that will have bonuses are 12, 33, 44, and 55. Take a l ook!", "After the bonus at 55, remove the token. Quarry Action (Place Province Tiles on your Player Board)  In the middle of the board are actions spaces (in 2 rows) with cost values from 1 -4 (remember to pay). Next to them is an icon of a tile being placed on a Province board. Well, activating 1 of these spaces will allow you to do just that! After placing your worker , and paying the cost, look at 1 of the 12 face -up Province tiles next to the board. You can \u201cbuy\u201d a face -up tile by returning any number of matching colored dice to the supply with a sum o f at least the value shown in the upper left corner. You can overpay for tiles this way. After paying for your tile with dice, take it and place it on your player board so that at least 1 road on the tile can be traced back to your Estate (the building in the upper middle). Yes, you can rotate your tile any direction you wish and you can cut off other roads, as long as 1 road on your newly placed tile can make its way back home! After you place your tile legally, you will earn rewards based on what is showing on the tile itself. o If 1 of the 4 buildings is showing, immediately earn Fame points equal to that building\u2019s currently Fame level. o If it shows 1 of the 3 Markets, earn money equal to the prin ted money shown. o Obviously, earn all rewards shown (you might have multiple buildings or multiple markets.)  Around the edge of your Province are special \u201cYield\u201d rewards. After scoring the Province tile itself, if a road connects to this Yield reward back to your Estate, you immediately get the bonus! If a Yield reward is blocked off, you can\u2019t earn it. When you are done getting your rewards, flip the next tile over in the stack you chose from. Market Action Spaces (Earn money based on Mark ets in your Province)  Just u nder the Quarry spaces are the Market action spaces. The each top row action space deals with a specific type of good, while the bottom spaces deal with all 3 different types of goods . If you place a worker on 1 of the top spac es, you will first give up a die with any numeric value on it (the higher the better possibilities,) and then do the following: o Each of these spaces is associated with 1 of the 3 goods found in the Markets of your Province ( tea, silk, spices .) o If you place your working on the T ea space, you will select a number of different tea markets i n your Province (that can be traced back to your Estate via roads ) up to the value on the die you turned in. (example, turn in a 3 die, you can count up to 3 different tea markets on your Province board. Turn in a 4, you can count 4\u2026 so on\u2026 ) o Calculate the total money shown on these different Markets and earn that amount of money immediately. o The Silk and Spice s space work exactly the same. If you place a worker on a bottom space ( no player may access both bottom spaces in the same round (3/4 p game,) see different color worker icons ,) then you will look at your Province board and choose 3 different type markets (1 tea, 1 silk, 1 spices) that trace back to your Estate via roads and earn the shown money value immediately! This space has no cost! River Action Spaces (Move your Boat on the River for Rewards)  Under the Market spaces is the Harbor, and this area controls the movement of your Boat on the river. Whenever a player is to move their boat during the game , they always move it forward, they never count spaces other players are on, and they immediately take the reward when the boat has stopped moving. The Harbor spaces all have a coin cost except the first space w hich is free ! When putting your worker here, discard any die with a 1, 2 or 3 value (see chart to the right in the Harbor). o If a 1 is discarded , the player moves their boat 1 unoccupied space up the river . o If a 2 is discarded, the player mov es their boa t 1-2 unoccupied spaces up the river, player \u2019s choice. o If a 3 is discarded, the player moves their boat 1 -3 unoccupied spaces up the river, player \u2019s choice. The last space of the River can hold several boats, but once you reach this space, you can\u2019t take boat actions anymore. See the Rulebook for the indivi dual descriptions of each space. Palace Action Spaces ( Ways to Manipulate your Dice pool)  The Palace takes up the bottom left part of the board. It includes 19 action spaces from the Chambers (people) all the way t o the Balcony space (shows \u201cshaking\u201d dice). These are what the spaces do in detail: o The 6 Chamber People  1 \u2013 Give up any value 1 die to get 2 fame points and take the 1st player marker for next round. 2 \u2013 Give up any value 2 die to get any 2 dice in return and 1 white yield token sitting on the white building .", "Gain the reward of the Y ield token immediately and discard it. If the pile runs out, reshuffle it. 3 \u2013 Give up any value 3 die to get 2 Karma and 1 die of your choice. 4 \u2013 Give up any value 4 die to advance 1 of your buildings up 1 level and earn 3 money . 5 \u2013 Give up any value 5 die to choose any Province tile, place it on top of any Province tile already built with a lower die cost, and pay 1+ dice totaling the difference in value of the 2 tiles in the color of the new tile. The new tile will not earn \u201c Yield rewards\u201d but it will earn rewards for what is on the tile itself. Also, this new tile must obey the laws of tile placement.", "It must be traceable back to the Estate. 6 \u2013 Give up any value 6 die to move your boat on the river exactly 6 unoccupied spaces . If you are within the last 6 river space s, you can\u2019t use this action anymore. Must be able to move exactly 6 spaces. o The Terrace /Balcony Spaces  The single space on the very end lets you take 2 money and re -roll any number of your dice. The spaces that are touching a colored die reward you with 1 die of that color. The spaces that show a colored die in the action space require 1 die of this color as payment to receive 2 dice of the other color as the reward. End of the Round:  After everyone has placed all their workers ( a player might have a skip ped turn if other players have more workers) the round will end. If a player took the 1st player marker by going to the #1 space in the Chambers, then that player is 1st player for the next round. If no one went to that space, pass the Elep hant clockwise. Ever yone now takes back all their workers placed this round and starts a new round! End Game :  During the round, when 1 player has their Fame marker reach and/or pass their money marker, the game is triggered. At this time, each player going clockwise unti l the last player is reached will get 1 more turn to place 1 more worker (if the last player is the one to trigger the game then the game will end now.)  When the game ends, the player who moved their Fa me and Money marker the furthest apart (ties broken b y the player who did this first) will win the game ! Navaratnas Version (Advance d Game) :  Instead of only being able to get 2 new workers like in the standard game, you can claim all 3 workers on the board. You will use the other side of the Kali Statue which allows you to only store 8 dice , instead of 10 in the standard game. You will use the other side of your Province Board as well.", "You will notice some empty Yield space s around the edge. o During Set -up, t ake the Brown Yield tiles, flip them face -down, and each pl ayer takes 1 randomly, looks at it, and covers up 1 of the 2 Brown Y ield spaces on their Province board . It doesn\u2019t matter which Brown space is covered. You won\u2019t earn the reward now, but you will earn it in game when you connect to this Yield token. See the descriptions of the new bonus Yield tokens in the rulebook. o You will now sort the 4 different color ed Yield tokens by color and place them face -up on their matching building s on the right side of the board. (Same area you put the white tokens face -down in the standard game.)  There are 2 ways to obtain new Yield tokens during the game: o When you select the #2 person in The Chambers. This person allows you to get a ny face -up Yield token from 1 of the buildings. Select 1 and add it to your Province b oard, but it can only cover up a matching color. You won\u2019t earn the reward yet, but you will earn it when you connect to this Yield token via a road going back to your Estate. o When you have fewer workers than others! If you are \u201cskipped over\u201d during a r ound because other players still have more workers, then you get to take 1 Yield token of your choice and place it on your Province board covering a matching color space. Again, the reward will be earned when you connect to this token with a road leading back to the Estate.", "You are not required to take Yield tokens when allowed, and you can\u2019t place a Yield token on top of another Yield token. The Ganga Module (Customize the River Spaces)  During set -up, mix the 8 river tokens face down, then roll a die. Count out that many spaces and choose 1 of the token to flip over and place on this space (creating a new space for the game). Repeat this process until you reach the end of the river. The final river space can\u2019t be covered up. All 8 riv er tokens might not be placed out. See the rulebook for a detailed description of the new tokens. Obviously, you can turn the tiles face -up and customize the river spaces however you wish for a certain strategic game.", "Review 1: Appearance The front of the box shows a beautiful landscape and river with a deity holding dice and is full of colour and detail. The back of the box shows a 2 player game in progress showcasing the majority of the components and gives a description of the theme of the game. The game has a good insert which holds the components well and makes setup a lot quicker. The player boards are well laid out but a little bland until you lay tiles on them during the game. The tiles are more detailed with various spices and buildings, along with a large number and colour to denote what they require to be built. The wooden coloured player components are easy to distinguish from one another and include some shaped meeples along with some bland cubes. The main board is a particular highlight of the components, it is very colourful and detailed and doesn\u2019t look overwhelming. Finally the dice are very good quality in bright colours with a nice weight to them. Gameplay The aim of the game is to make your fame and wealth track markers intersect one another, these run in parallel around the board in opposite directions. When a player\u2019s 2 markers intersect the end of the game is triggered, with the player with the biggest difference between the 2 markers winning if multiple player\u2019s tokens intersected. Each turn players will place workers, pay any costs associated with the spot and carry out the action listed. These costs vary from moving back on the money track to paying a specific colour or numbered dice. Players will continue to place workers until all workers have been placed and the board will then reset with players collecting back all their workers and the next round can begin as long as the end game hasn\u2019t been triggered. There are 4 main different worker placement areas: the quarry, market place, palace and harbour. Using the quarry worker area you can build a province tile into your personal province. There are 12 different province tiles on offer at any time, 3 for each different coloured dice. Your must pay the listed money cost when placing your worker along with matching coloured dice of equal to or greater pip value than the tile you are acquiring. You must place these tiles with a direct path back to your starting palace on your province. You gain any yields that you connect to on the edge of your province and receive the money from any markets on the tile. You also receive fame for any buildings on the tile based on your position on that buildings scroll track on the main board, so between 2 and 4 fame. There are various actions and bonuses on the board that allow you to move up on the 4 building scroll tracks. The market worker area allows you to collect income from the markets in your province, either from the same type of market or different ones. When activating the same market you must pay a dice and can only activate as many markets as the pip value of the dice. The palace has 3 main areas the terrace, balconies and the chamber. In the terrace and balconies you can either collect a specific coloured dice of your choice or trade one coloured dice for 2 of a different coloured dice. Whenever you collect dice you roll themand place them onto your Kali statue if you have room. You can always spend karma (if you have it) to flip a dice when you need to pay a cost. In the chambers you can spend a dice of a specific number to activate one of the characters for a specific action. These include gaining dice, karma, scroll movement, taking first player and building over province tiles in your area. In the harbour you can move your boat 1 to 3 spaces on the river and take the listed bonus on the space you end your movement on. The amount of spaces you move depends on the value of the dice spent. Boats cannot be on the same space and you simply skip spaces opponents boats are present on. The bonuses are very similar to the other actions on the board but towards the end reward dice, money or fame based on a condition such as number of karma, scroll movement or markets built in your province. You start the game with 3 workers but can unlock up to 3 more from the fame, money and river tracks when your corresponding marker passes them. Play continues until the end of the game when one player\u2019s score markers intersect. Play continues until every player has played an even number of turns and then the winner is determined. The turns flow very naturally in this game with simple to resolve actions and costs to pay. The game plays 2 to 4 players and an unofficial solo automa is also available on bgg. Theme and Game Length The game has a good theme, different to many other Euro games of this weight but it doesn\u2019t really come through in the actions you are performing. Why are you trying to get wealth and fame to meet, who are these characters and why does the river give the bonuses it does. Gaining workers makes slightly more sense as when you get more famous on the 3 tracks more people are willing to work for your province. The game doesn\u2019t drag at all and is actually quite fast for the level of decisions offered. The game scales well with 2 different sizes of the board to tighten up the worker placement spots. The game takes about 20 minutes per player which is very good considering the weight of decisions you make. Strategy There are two main ways to score points in this game, wealth and fame. It is very hard to just work on just one of these and win so over the course of the game you will be earning both. Players will differ in their overall strategy but there is only the one way to win, intersecting your markers. A focus you must have is to get more workers as quickly as possible. The two workers that can be unlocked on the wealth and fame tracks are the easiest to obtain. The wealth track also offers multiple other bonuses so is the track you should target at the start of the game. If other players have more workers than you for too long you have no chance of winning with the yield tiles offering too little in compensation for the worker placement actions they are taking. Each fame is worth 2 money so this obviously looks more appealing to try and race up but without the track bonuses this shouldn\u2019t be an early game focus. Instead you should look to increase your scrolls for the 4 building types. If you specialise in one or twobuilding types other players may build tiles with that building type to prevent you from building it. Also with 4 different building types the tiles that may come out may not be the ones you get extra fame for so it\u2019s probably best to spread your scroll movement out. A space that you cannot underestimate is the space to activate up to 3 different markets in your province. You want to make sure to build 3 different high value markets as soon as possible to take advantage of this space. This spot (or spots in the 3/4 player games) is usually the first spot players go to at the start of each round from the mid game onwards. It costs no dice and can yield anywhere from 3 to 9 money which is better than any other spot due to having no costs. Activating multiple markets of the same type can also be good but requires a lot of the same market to be built which depends a lot of the tiles that come out. Many of the spots cost dice of various values with every value having a potential good use. If you get lots of high value dice you should be using these to build tiles, trying not to waste too much pip value. The lower value dice can be used for some of the characters or more likely the river. The river is sort of split into two halves by your unlockable worker with the first half offering small bonuses like dice, scroll movement and fame. The later half offers powerful one off bonuses like activating multiple markets or gaining fame and money based on a condition.", "It is perfectly viable to skip most of the early bonuses and plan to maximise these powerful one off bonuses instead. With so many spots costing dice you always want to make sure you don\u2019t run out. You should never take the terrace actions to gain one dice as it is so inefficient and should instead look to use bonuses to acquire dice or trade one dice for two. In the higher player count games you also want to make sure you are not 3rd or 4th in turn order for long due to some worker placement spots being clearly better than others and you can really fall behind if you are not careful.", "There have been some runaway leader problems in the games that I have played of this. During the mid game it became obvious who was going to win generally because of the market setup they had on their board. This meant one worker could gain them 6 \u2013 12 money with each action which was much stronger than the other players. Newer players will struggle with experienced players with both tracks to manage and not being able to distinguish which worker placement spots are better than others. The game has modest replayability as you are aiming to do the same thing each time and the way the tiles come out and what dice values you get will change each game. The game also comes with several modules which significantly help replayability and make the game better in my opinion with ways to customise your province. The game can end very suddenly and can be difficult to plan for so you need to be building towards the end of the game constantly. Accessibility The game is light to medium weight with simple to perform and resolve actions but some setup on your province tile required to do well. There is also some consideration needed for when and where to place your workers to maximise their benefits. The game is very easy to teach with obvious iconography and the main board layout also helps. Therulebook is excellent, very clearly laid out rules with multiple examples and text descriptions of each worker placement spot. The game takes up a decent amount of table space with each player\u2019s province, the main board and places for tiles and dice. Final Thoughts Rajas of the Ganges is a good next step worker placement Euro game with simple to understand rules and great components. The game has good flow to it with your points increasing steadily before exploding towards the end.", "One of my main problems is the market space on the main board especially the activate 3 different ones in your province. This is way too strong due to having no cost and makes first player way too powerful in this game with players needing to shift it multiple rounds in a row to mitigate this. I really like the scoring in this game it\u2019s fairly unique and offers different considerations unlike normal Euro style games. I also like the fact that all values of dice have uses in this game so even though low numbers aren\u2019t good for building you can use them on characters and the river or to trade. A solid light to medium weight game.Review 2: Overview: Power is where fame and wealth intersect. In \"Rajas of the Ganges\" [Rajas] you'll play the part of one of the minor nobles along the Ganges river seeking your fortune. By sending your representatives to build your estates, hobnob at the high mogul's palace, and trade on the Ganges River, you'll race to be the first to cement your power. Of course a little help from karma never hurts...", "Hardware: Rajas has mechanics present in other games, but what makes it unusual is the combination of mechanics present. This is reflected in the game's unusual collection of bits, including 48 dice (12 each of different colors). The meeples are pretty standard wooden fare but the art printed on the various boards helps to fuel the theme. Gameplay: It would have been easy for Rajas to degenerate into a much-maligned point salad of simple worker placement. Indeed, there are probably some players out there who would argue that's what it really is anyway. There were two things about Rajas that for me that pulled it ahead of the just-another-sad-Euro crowd: dice manipulation, and the scoring tracks. Certain actions taken through Rajas will require dice showing certain numbers or dice of certain colors. It's not quite currency as there is a \"money\" track, but thematically I think of the dice as the ups-and-downs involved in the pursuit of fortune and glory. Among the actions you can take are turning in individual dice for two dice of a different color, or placing workers to gain individual dice if you're out of options and running out of dice.", "Running out of dice will severely handicap you so it always pays to think ahead as far as you can. What's that you say? Dice hate you? In Rajas, having low dice is an advantage if you want to use them to sail the Ganges. And if you need a 6 when you rolled a 1, the \"Karma\" mechanic allows you to flip a die to its opposite side as you go to pay for an action. All in all, Rajas is far more skill based than the presence of dice might suggest. Finally there's the scoring. This element of Rajas stands out perhaps more than any other. Two tracks surrounding the board represent wealth, which is fairly mercurial but easier to get (and must be spent on certain actions along the way), and fame, which is not as easy to get but can not be lost once it is acquired. The ultimate goal is to make the tracks pass each other as they move in opposite directions. The goal is simple but as you may have already figured out, the gameplay is not. Besides sending representatives to the high mogul's palace you will also be buildingyour own estate on a separate board with an eye towards the wealth and fame that those buildings can bring. Pros: The dice and scoring tracks make for a rather unusual, if not unique, game overall. If you're a fan of worker placment-style Euros, you'll probably slide right into Rajas quite comfortably. Rajas does not rely heavily on text outside of the rulebook. That can help when trying to teach someone the game who isn't fluent in English.", "Cons: There can be something of a point-salad feel. The limited number of actions you can take out of all the available actions in a turn can lead to some pretty severe analysis paralysis. There can be a sense that the game is decided quite early when one player breaks out far ahead of the others.", "This tends to be less of a problem in 3-4 player games, though it can happen in any player count. Final Thoughts: Rajas of the Ganges is in some ways a natural evolution of the worker placement genre. It adds a layer of complexity when compared to some older worker placement games which I happen to like. It's now available for play at Yucata.de and I definitely recommend giving it a try.", "Rajas of the Ganges Strategy Guide Introduction Rajas of the Ganges holds a special place among my favorite games, as it provides a clear path to mastery. This article aims to enhance the gameplay for those with similar goals, specifically for 2-player games (Navaratnas + Ganga module), but many principles also apply to higher player counts. Macro View Mixed > Money = Fame The game concludes when the fame and money tracks intersect. Thus, players can opt to focus heavily on money, fame, or pursue a mixed strategy. In a balanced strategy, players benefit from both tracks, making it generally more advantageous. A slight emphasis on money is preferred due to better bonuses (river and dice) compared to fame (upgrade, karma, and river). However, a fame-heavy strategy can still be successful. In Raja of the Ganges, flexibility is key, and understanding your best options at any given moment is crucial. Evaluating the Board State at the Start of the Game to Decide on Strategy 1 market of each kind & 3 and 4 directional tiles By default, seek market tiles of each kind (green/yellow/red) providing 2-3 coins to quickly form 3 different markets for 6-9 coins. Two-markets-in-one tile and affordable market tiles are also viable. The 3-different-markets meeple spot offers the best VP-to-cost ratio, as it requires investment in only 3 tiles and costs no dice. If acquiring these tiles is challenging, consider going for monument upgrades. In such cases, focus on 3 or 4 directional monument tiles or those combining monuments and market tiles to build both the fame and money tracks simultaneously. For example, in the given illustration, consider '7' blue (since green Market is rare) and then either \u20185\u2019 Orange, \u20189\u2019 Green, or \u20187\u2019 Purple. This tile evaluation remains relevant throughout the game as you aim to build towards the bottom for the most rewarding outcomes. Deciding between \"sub-par\" 3 or 4 directional tiles (usually market tiles) and tiles that fit your monument upgrades will likely determine your chosen strategy, whether Heavy Money, Mixed, or Heavy Fame. Dice Management 3 karma dice River > 3 color dice River > Dancer > 2 dice River > 1-for-2 dice > 1 dice Dice color matters only when building.Dice plays a crucial role in lubricating your VP engine. In order of preference, obtain dice through the following methods: 1 River spot (1 die per karma): The uniform color aids in building tiles. 2 River spot (2 dice) is superior to 1-for-2 dice exchange because it advances the river track, providing better rewards and an extra meeple. 3 Dancer: While Dancer is more useful in the early game, it gradually loses its edge as you accumulate enough yield tiles. 4 1-for-2 dice exchange is usually better than acquiring 1 dice because more dice of the same color make building easier, and you get a free roll of the die you gave up. Think of it as receiving a new die, rerolling your die, and giving it a different color. Consider saving a die to acquire more dice, as this is typically the trade-off.", "With dice, focus on increasing both money and fame. Strategies for Resource Acquisition in Rajas of the Ganges How to Get Money - Different market spot - No. 4 - River spots - Connecting to the bottom of the board (longer than the top but more worthwhile in the long run) - 1 market (only worth if activating 3 or more) How to Get Fame - No. 4 then build monuments - Board - River spots How to Quickly Get Your 6 Workers In the Advanced game, you start with 3 workers and can unlock 3 more by advancing on the Money, Fame, and River tracks. Rushing for 6 workers is beneficial, outweighing the drawback of yielding tiles to opponents. This is because 1 worker is minimally worth 1 die, and the benefit of yield tiles diminishes as opponents acquire more. River is your good friend - If you have a good Money set-up (3 different markets), focus on river spots giving fame - If you have a good Fame set-up (min. 3 monument upgrades), focus on river spots giving money While it's preferable to get 3 markets and then focus on fame for the extra worker, circumstances may not allow this, usually due to tile constraints. In such cases, focus on fame but make a conscious effort to obtain all the Money bonuses on the river. Anticipate whether your opponent is using the 'build' or 'river' locations and try to beat them to it or delay your visit to these locations until the next round if there are no compelling reasons to visit this round. The goal is to secure the worker on the Money track.The river is an excellent place to utilize low rolls and can yield various rewards. Climbing it strategically for the rewards you need (usually dice + fame or money) is key. The Portuguese (#6) turns out to be more useful than perceived, particularly when moving up the river without #6 is challenging. Keep this in mind when deciding whether to use the '6' dice to build tiles or ascend the river. #6 can also be a good option when landing on the river reward that allows you to pick one of #1 - #5 bonuses. What Yield Tiles to Pick Ensure you have a good Brown end-game yield tile - Based on my observation, players prefer taking yield tiles in this order: Red/Brown > Yellow/White. - Starting with a bad brown yield token can be detrimental, and players should quickly exchange it for a good brown yield token. Only the bolded tiles below consistently provide 6 or more fame. Quote: 1 fame per 3 river spots > 1 fame per worker > 1 fame per market >> = 2 coins per monument upgrade >>> 2 coins per tile connected >>>> 1 coin per building = 2 fame per bend For white, yellow and red yield tiles, - If you have a weak Money engine, pick Money - If you are approaching the yield tile soon and lack dice, pick dice Others (Base Game) the most optimal way to build is to go down the center and build both ends - The bottom rewards are significantly more potent. Consider this scenario (and how you should generally build in the base game): 4 Fame & 7 money or 6 money & 8 Money. If lacking dice, consider taking a detour to the 2nd bottom row first, as it is more valuable than going down the sides where you get 3 dice before reaching your rewards. - For the Advanced mode, route choice is flexible; pick a route that aligns with what you want to build. Withhold building to punish opponents for acquiring dice in the color of the tile you want and can get - This is an advanced consideration when players have a good sense of whether a given tile is sought after by others. Otherwise, it's generally better to buy a tile first, see what that tile is, before obtaining dice to better adapt to the available tiles for purchase. Parting Remarks Critics have pointed out Rajas of the Ganges for being scripted on a strategic level, but the game's essence lies in tactical decisions. It's 80% tactical, akin to navigating a maze in the fog.", "The fun lies in assessing the most likely path based on limited information. I hope this guide aids those striving to enhance their gameplayAddendum: As nandblock rightly points out in the comments, the Master Builder is often overlooked. There are a few advantages to it, namely: Converts dead ends to live paths (translating to creating dead ends for yield rewards and then over-building to continue the path) Provides the ability to snag a tile if you lack enough dice of the same color to build conventionally Saves coins. I have used it effectively too.", "Note that these advantages must be weighed against not advancing your path (since you are replacing and not adding a new tile). In 2-player games, I have been humbled by players frequently picking the Great Mogul. The Great Mogul can be a very good pick if both players have developed their 3 markets. Let's say both players can get 6 coins from the spot, the Great Mogul can represent a 12-coins swing (+6 to you, -6 to your opponent). This is also very good if it would help you or stop your opponent from getting a reward on the Money track. That said, you still have to weigh it against advancing 1 river step or converting to 6 for Portuguese or building tiles.", "Game Help \u2013 Rajas of the Ganges Objective: Develop your province to obtain a combination of wealth and fame. Fame and money tracks run parallel in opposite directions, whoever crosses their markers first has a high chance of winning. Development: The game is divided into rounds, in each round you will take turns in a clockwise direction. On each turn, you place a worker, pay the cost (money: move the money track marker backwards; or dice: return them to the reserve), if required, and perform the associated action. When all the workers have been placed, the round ends, they are removed from the board and a new round begins. There can only be one worker per space. Actions: Construction: Place a province tile on your personal board and earn fame and/or money. Each tile has a cost in dice that must be covered by one or more of your own dice. Each tile placed in the province must be connected by roads to your starting residence. If the tile has market(s), you earn the coins indicated on it, if the tile has building(s) you earn 2/3/4 fame points, depending on how much you have upgraded the building(s). If a symbol or production token on the edge of the board is connected by a road, you immediately earn a prize. Market: Money is earned from certain markets in the province. If the space has multiple action types, money is earned from exactly one market of each good type. If the space has only one market type, a die is given and resources are earned from as many markets of that type as the value of the die. Actions in the palace: A die is given (if requested) and a benefit is obtained. Outdoor Terrace (Free): Take 2 coins and roll your own dice again. Terrace (free): Take one die of the corresponding color and add it to your personal reserve. Balconies (1 die): You are given one die of a specific color, and you get 2 of a different color. Cameras (1 die of any color with a specific value): Great Mogul: Roll a 1 and gain 2 Fame Points and the starting player token. Dancer: Roll a 2, and you get any 2 dice and a production token.", "This is placed on your personal board. (If you are playing the introductory game, you collect it immediately.) Yogi: You roll a 3, you gain 2 karmas and any dice. Raja Man Sigh: Roll a 4, and you get a building upgrade and 3 coins. Master Builder: Roll a 5, cover any tile in the province with one in the reserve, it must still be connected by roads to the residence. The new tile must be more expensive than the previous one, pay the difference in points with dice.On a roll of 6, you move exactly 6 spaces along the river and gain the benefit where your move ends. River: Roll a die with a value of 1/2/3 and advance up to 1/2/3 spaces along the river. Spaces occupied by other players are not counted and are skipped.", "You earn the rewards for the space you have reached. Karma: At any time during your turn, pay 1 Karma to flip a die to the opposite side. (Opposite sides add up to 7.) Getting new workers: As you progress through the fame, money and river tracks, you will gain new workers. Prizes on fame and money tracks: In addition to workers, other prizes can be won on these tracks: building upgrades, karma, river movements, dice. These prizes are only won the first time the marker reaches them. End of round: The round ends when no player has any unassigned workers, and those players with fewer workers have obtained a production token. The workers are removed from the board and a new round begins. End of the game: As soon as someone manages to have their fame marker and money marker cross, the end of the game is triggered. The \u201cturn\u201d of the round is finished so that everyone has the same number of turns. Then, if there are more than two players who managed to make their markers cross, each player counts the difference in fame points between his fame marker and his money marker. Whoever has the largest difference has won the game.", "India in the era of the aspiring Mogul empire. New lands are being gained along with great prosperity attained through the trading of silk, tea, and spices. Imposing structures such as the Taj Mahal and the Red Fort are built, and gorgeous gardens are created alongside new buildings and parks that will impress generations to come even centuries later. At a time when the empire has almost reached its greatest dimensions and is in a phase of relative stability, players, representing rajas and ranis, are called upon to live up to the requirements of their role as venerable sovereigns.

Mix the 12 stacks separately and put them face up next to the gameboard, well visible to everybody.Mix the 8 white yield tiles and put them as a face-down stack on the temple.

This continues until nobody can place a worker any more. After that, each player takes his workers back, and a new round begins. Workers can be placed in the following areas on the gameboard: I. At the quarry, in order to carry out building actions on your province board. II. At the market place, in order to receive money through market scorings later in the game. III. In the Great Mogul\u2019s palace, in order to get various benefits there. IV. At the harbor, in order to advance on the river and thus reach lucrative river spaces. At the quarry and at the harbor, workers are always placed row by row from left to right. At the market place and in the palace, you can choose any (unoccupied) action space. While advancing on the fame and money tracks and developing your province board, you will have chances to obtain valuable bonuses. Placing workers and carrying out the associated actions The placement of workers always proceeds in this order: 1. Place a worker 2. Pay costs, if required: give up money and/or dice3. Carry out the action Costs: Depending on what action space you place a worker on, you might have to pay costs for being allowed to carry out the applicable action. Some spaces are for free; for others, you have to give up dice or money. How much it costs to place a worker on an action space is shown on the action space itself. On each action space there may be only one worker. Dice are never placed onto the board, but always into the (general or personal) supply!Pay money for an action: Every time you have to pay money for an action (e.g., at the harbor or the quarry), you move your money marker back on the money track accordingly \u2013 1 space for each money you have to pay. If your marker is sitting on 0, you have no money left and temporarily cannot carry out any actions that cost money. The same applies to actions for which you have to pay dice \u2013 if you don\u2019t have any (suitable) dice, you can\u2019t carry out the applicable action.", "Dice are the most important resource in this game. Whenever you get a die from the general supply, you roll it immediately and, with the rolled number facing up, add it to your own supply, i.e., on your Kali statue. The value of the die conforms to the number rolled (from 1 to 6). Attention! You may store only as many dice as Kali has free hands \u2013 that means, in the basic game you may own a maximum of 10 dice. If you get into a situation that would get you more dice, you either take fewer dice or put dice from your Kali statue back into the general supply before taking new ones.

Depending on the space where you place the worker, you pay 1 to 4 money on the money track. In return, you acquire one of the 12 province tiles on open display. On the top left of the tiles you can see what dice with which total minimum value you have to give up in order to take the tile. Put dice of the respective color back into the supply. Their total value has to be at least as high as the one shown on the tile. When building, you are allowed to overpay. That means: In order to acquire a tile with the value \u201cblue 7,\u201c you can pay with a blue 3 and a blue 5, for example. Besides the costs, the tiles also depict roads, buildings and/or markets. Once you acquire a province tile, you immediately have to place it onto your province board. Example: Rajesh sends one of his workers into the quarry.", "He pays 1 money. Then he puts 2 orange dice back into the supply. He takes the tile with the orange 9 and connects it to an already-existing road on his province board. The province boards The province board shows the territory that you, being a raja, control and strive to expand. Your residence is in the middle on the top; from there, 3 roads lead into the country. Every time you add a new province tile, the end of one of its roads has to connect to an already-existing road, so that there is a connection to the residence. You can turn the new tile in any direction. You may also orient a tile in such a way that it cuts off a road of an adjacent tile; not all road ends need to be connected \u2013 it is sufficient that each tile is connected to the residence through at least one road. Once placed, the tiles cannot be relocated later on. Be careful not to cut off all roads, so that you always have good possibilities for placing a tile.Special yields \u2013 There are yields printed on the edge of the province boards (symbolically, for special gains due to trade relations you have established). You get these immediately when you have connected them to your residence via a road, after scoring for the province tile itself (see below). Example: Leila puts a province tile with a bend in the corner on the left. Since the ends of the road on the tile connect to both adjacent yields and are thus connected to the residence, Leila is allowed to take any 1 die from the supply and advance her money marker 5 spaces. Of course, it is also possible to place a tile without creating a connection to the special yield. In this case, you don\u2019t get anything extra. When you have added a new tile to your province, you immediately score money and/or fame for it. Some tiles show one or two market tents with certain goods (silk, tea, or spices) of a certain value; other tiles show one or two buildings (temple, palace, fort, or mill); and a few tiles show a combination of both. When you add a tile with one or two markets to your province, you immediately receive the amount of money indicated on that tile. When you add a tile with one or two buildings, you immediately receive 2, 3, or 4 fame points for each building, depending on where your upgrade cube is on the scroll for the corresponding building on the gameboard. The upgades of the buildings The 4 types of buildings that you can erect in your province are shown on the gameboard. At the beginning of the game, your upgrade cubes lie on the first level of each building \u2013 i.e., you earn 2 fame points when you add a province tile with 1 building (or, likewise, 4 fame points for 2 buildings). Upgrades enable you to improve your constructional skills and to earn 3 (or 4) points for a certain building type in later building actions. I. L L L X X X X X X X X 16You can acquire upgrades from the raja at the palace by giving up a value-4 die there (see p. 18, \u201cThe Chambers\u201c). In addition, there is a river space that allows you an upgrade. And you may upgrade a building automatically after you have crossed the applicable bonus space (space 5) on the fame track or connect the applicable special yield on your province board. When you are allowed to upgrade, you choose one of the four building types and move your upgrade cube one space to the right in the corresponding row. Attention! Upgrades don\u2019t count for buildings on tiles that are already lying in your province, but only for buildings that you add after upgrading. Example: There are 2 buildings on the bend that Leila has added.", "She advances her fame marker 5 spaces, since she earns 2 points for the temple plus 3 points for the mill \u2013 which she already upgraded once in an earlier turn. Since she has connected a special yield to the road network and the residence by placing the tile, she may \u2013 after scoring for the tile \u2013 take another die of any color and upgrade a building of her choice.Market action (market place) Collect money for certain markets in your province Every time you send a worker to one of the market spaces, you generate income for the markets laid out in your province. There are markets with 3 kinds of goods: silk tea spices and 2 types of market spaces: Assorted goods \u2013 when you place a worker here, you may score for exactly one market per kind of good. Example: There are 4 markets on display in Rajesh\u2019s province \u2013 three of them with tea and one with silk. If he places one of his workers on this market space, he can score for 2 markets: the silk market plus one of the 3 tea markets. For this, he gets 5 money. Goods of one kind \u2013 when you place a worker here, you have to give up any one die. Then you may score for up to a maximum of as many markets of one kind of good as corresponds to the value of the die. Example: If Rajesh places his worker on this market space and gives up a die with a value of 4, he can score for all 3 tea markets and gets 7 money for this. Attention! In the 3- or 4-player game, you may place only one of your workers on the assorted goods market in a round; that means, if you have placed a worker on the first space, the second space is no longer available to you in this round. It can then only be used by another player. However, you still have the possibility to place workers on the other market type.", "II. upgrade symbol 17Actions at the palace Give up a die, if required, and get a benefit When you place a worker in the Great Mogul\u2019s palace, this can be without cost or may require giving up one die \u2013 a die of either a specific color or an exact number. The palace has the following areas: The outer terrace (cost: free) Take 2 money. You may also reroll as many of your dice as you want. The terrace (cost: free) Take 1 die of the applicable color from the supply. Example: Leila takes one orange die from the supply, rolls it and puts it on her Kali statue. The balconies (cost: 1 die of a specific color) Give up 1 die of a specific color and get 2 dice of a different color. Example: Rajesh gives up one blue die (of any value) and takes 2 orange dice; he rolls them immediately and puts them on his Kali statue. The chambers (cost: 1 die of any color with an exact number) Great Mogul \u2013 Give up one die showing a \u201c1.\u201c In return, you get 2 fame points and become the starting player in the next round. Dancer \u2013 Give up one die showing a \u201c2.\u201c In return, you take any 2 dice from the supply and draw a face-down white yield tile. You immediately earn the yield of the tile (1 die, 3 money, 1 upgrade, or 1 karma). Then the yield tile is put aside to form a discard pile. When you run out of tiles, reshuffle the used ones and form a new supply. Yogi \u2013 Give up one die showing a \u201c3.\u201d In return, you get 2 karma and 1 die of your choice (see p. 20, explanations of the karma). Raja Man Singh \u2013 Give up one die showing a \u201c4.\u201d In return, you upgrade a building type of your choice and earn 3 money. Master builder \u2013 Give up one die showing a \u201c5.\u201d Cover any tile in your province with another one from the supply. All tiles still need to have a connection to the residence. You cannot use the master builder if you have no matching tiles or dice. Important: The new tile has to be more expensive than the old one; just pay the difference by giving up 1 (or more) dice in the color of the new tile. You may overpay. Example: Leila gives up a green value-5 die. She wants to overbuild the tile with the orange \u201c 4\u201d by covering it with the tile with the violet \u201c6.\u201d To do so, she has to give up a violet die with a value of at least 2. When covering a tile, you do not receive any special yield again. You may cover every province tile only once. Portuguese \u2013 Give up one die showing a \u201c6.\u201d In return, you advance exactly 6 unoccupied spaces on the river and get the applicable earnings. Attention! When you have advanced to the last 6 spaces on the river, you may not use the Portuguese anymore. III. 18River action (harbor) Give up a die showing a 1, 2, or 3 and advance up to three unoccupied spaces on the river The river action can be used only if you give up a \u201c1,\u201d \u201c2,\u201d or \u201c3.\u201d Every time you place a worker at the harbor, you may advance your boat up to three unoccupied spaces on the river, depending on the number on the die you have given up. The harbor provides space for several workers. The first worker placed here doesn\u2019t cost anything; workers placed later cost 1 or 2 money. If you give up a die showing a \u201c1,\u201d you advance exactly one unoccupied space; if you give up a \u201c2,\u201d you advance one or two unoccupied spaces; if you give up a \u201c3,\u201d you may advance up to three unoccupied spaces. Spaces occupied by other players\u2019 boats are not included in the count but are skipped. So there can never be more than one boat on any particular river space.The only exceptions to this are the starting space and the final river space where multiple boats may rest. You immediately get the earnings of the space where you stop your boat. Example: Leila places a worker at the harbor. For this, she has to pay 1 money. Then she gives up a die showing a \u201c2\u201d and advances her boat 2 spaces. She doesn\u2019t include the space that is occupied by another player\u2019s yellow boat in the count. She earns an upgrade of one building type. She moves her upgrade cube at the mill from \u201c3\u201d to \u201c 4.\u201d Explanation of the earnings on the river: Take 2 dice of any colors from the supply, roll them, and put them on your Kali statue. Increase your karma 2 levels (see p.", "20, explanations of the karma). Receive the amount of money indicated; advance accordingly on the money track.Choose any of the palace actions 2 - 6 (Dancer, Yogi, Raja, Master builder or Portuguese) and carry it out immediately without placing a worker in the palace or giving up a die (the space in the palace may even be occupied). For each level of karma that you have at this moment, take one die in the depicted color (so receive 0 to 3 dice). Receive the number of fame points indicated; advance accordingly on the fame track. Upgrade a building type 1 level (e.g., move your temple cube from 2 to 3). Receive 1 money for each market that you have built in your province so far (if you have 5 markets, for example, you advance your money marker 5 spaces on the money track). Conduct a market scoring for up to a maximum of markets of assorted goods. Collect the money for up to 3 different markets (see p. 17, explanation of the markets). Conduct a market scoring for goods of one kind that you have in your province, up to the maximum indicated on the river. If you have 4 silk markets, for example, you can score for all of them and advance on the money track accordingly. You do not have to give up a die for this (see p. 17, explanation of the markets). Receive 1 fame point per building upgrade that you have done up to now (if you have already upgraded buildings 3 times, for example, you advance 3 spaces on the fame track). Receive 2 money per building upgrade that you have done up to now (if you have already upgraded buildings 3 times, for example, you advance 6 spaces on the money track). Receive 2 fame points per karma that you have at the moment (if your karma is at level 2, for example, you advance 4 spaces on the fame track). When you have arrived at the final river space, you can no longer use the river action. IV.", "2 3 1 19Karma Give up 1 karma and turn a die to the number on the opposite side You can influence the result of a die roll through karma. One karma allows you to turn any die on your Kali statue to the opposite side when you place it; that means a \u201c1\u201d can turn into a \u201c6\u201d and vice versa, a \u201c2\u201d into a \u201c5,\u201d etc. You start the game with karma at level 1. Over the course of the game, you can improve your karma \u2013 for instance, by sending a worker to the Yogi in the palace (see p. 18, \u201cThe Chambers\u201d \u201cYogi\u201d) or by stopping your boat on the applicable river space (see p. 19, \u201cRiver action\u201d). Besides this, there is a bonus space on the fame track (space 24) that increases your karma 2 levels if your fame marker stops on that space or crosses it. The highest karma level is 3; that means you may have a maximum of 3 karma. In order to use karma, you don\u2019t have to place any worker \u2013 you may use your karma anytime during your turn when giving up a die. For each karma you use, you move your karma cube 1 level down. So the karma can even go down to zero. Get new workers Move forward on the scoring tracks or on the river and receive more workers At the beginning of the game, each player has 3 active workers at his disposal. During the course of the game, you can get up to 2 additional workers. If you have advanced far enough on the respective scoring tracks (money: space 20; fame: space 15) or on the river (bridge), you receive extra workers. Important: As soon as you have received your second inactive worker (no matter whether on one of the tracks or the river), you immediately take your extra one off the board and remove him from the game. The fame and the money tracks as well as the river each have one space with an inactive worker per player color. The spaces on the scoring tracks with the inactive workers are regular spaces; at the moment when your money marker or fame marker stops on the respective space or crosses it, you take the worker of your color. With this, he becomes active. The inactive worker on the river doesn\u2019t have his own river space (the bridge doesn\u2019t count as a river space); that means, when your boat has passed the bridge, you take the worker of your color.You never lose a worker once you have activated him this way, even if your marker falls back (which can happen only on the money track). You can place a new worker even in the same round in which you have obtained him. Bonuses on the scoring tracks Arrive at the space and receive the bonus Besides the inactive workers, the two scoring tracks also have special spaces; when you reach or cross them, you immediately get the corresponding bonus. The fame track has 3 bonus spaces: Space 5: You receive an upgrade of a building type of your choice. (This upgrade counts from your next turn on.) Space 24: You may increase your karma 2 levels. Space 31: You may move your boat to the next unoccupied river space and get the applicable earnings. The money track has 4 bonus spaces: Spaces 12 and 44: You may move your boat to the next unoccupied river space and get the applicable earnings. Spaces 33 and 55: You may take any 2 dice from the supply, roll them, and put them on your Kali statue. Since you pay money and can thus fall back on the money track, there is a special bonus marker of your color that indicates which bonus you\u2019ll get next on the money track. When you reach or cross space 12 for the first time and get the applicable bonus, you take the marker of your color, turn it over and put it on space 33 (die side facing up). When your money marker reaches or crosses this space as well, you turn the marker back and put it on space 44 (river space side facing up), etc. After you have crossed the last bonus space on the money track, you remove your marker from the game. Attention! A bonus applies only to the track where it is printed. If, for example, your money marker passes a bonus space printed on the adjoining fame track, you don\u2019t get the bonus from there, of course. 20After you have placed all of your active workers and carried out the applicable actions, the round ends. If one of the players has placed a worker at the Great Mogul, he now gets the starting player elephant and becomes the starting player End of a Round End of the Game Notesof the following round. If nobody has sent a worker to the Great Mogul, the elephant goes from the previous starting player clockwise to the next player. All players take all their active workers off the gameboard and put them back below their Kali statue. After that, the starting player begins the new round. As soon as one player manages to have his fame marker and his money marker converge or pass each other, the end of the game is triggered. The current stage will still be completed \u2013 i.e., all players who are sitting between the player who has triggered the end of the game and the current starting player still have a chance to win and may place one more worker (provided they have any left) and carry out the applicable action. In order to develop your province successfully and to win the race, you primarily need money, dice, and workers. It is important to make sure that you don\u2019t run out of dice or of money and don\u2019t have to make do with fewer workers than the other players for too long. To summarize in brief: Gain additional workers by advancing on the two scoring tracks and on the river. Generate money primarily through markets; build them in your province and use workers to activate them. Additionally, bonuses on your province board, After that, players check who has won. If there are two or more players whose markers passed each other on their final turn, each of the players involved counts the difference of fame points between his money marker and his fame marker; the player with the most points wins the game. In case of a tie, the first player whose two markers passed each other wins. (To find out who is second and third, etc., count the number of fame points that are still separating your fame marker from your money marker.) on the river, and from the raja in the palace are good sources of money. Such bonus spaces can get you extra dice as well. The palace also provides opportunities to obtain and exchange individual dice. To fulfill the winning conditions, you need to establish a well thought-out road network within your province and gain as many special yields as possible. To this end, you will use the building action on the gameboard, for which you pay money and dice. Buildings in your province give you fame points; markets give you money. Example: Rajesh\u2019s money marker has passed his fame marker. His money marker is now on space 65 of the money track, his fame marker on space 30 of the fame track. Then Leila has her final turn. She also manages to have her two markers pass each other. Her money marker ends up on space 52 of the money track, her fame marker on space 37 of the fame track. So Rajesh and Leila both have a difference of 2 fame points (it doesn\u2019t matter where the money marker is). Since Rajesh was the first to have his two markers pass each other, he ekes out the win. 21Play with 6 workers, 8 dice, and upgraded special yields After having played the basic version for one or more games, you can opt for the \u201cNavaratnas\u201c version for advanced players (English \u201cThe Nine Gems\u201c, see p. 24, Mogul Lexicon Raja Man Singh I). Here, the following modifications apply: You can activate all 3 inactive workers. So you may play with up to 6 workers. You play with the back of your Kali statue and you may store only up to 8 dice. You play on the back of your province board.", "Here also, special yields are printed on the edge of the province board, which you can connect to your road network. However, these are only minor yields, but you can improve them during the course of the game. At the beginning of the game, mix the brown yield tiles. Each player randomly picks one, reveals it and puts it on one of the two possible spaces on his province board. You decide which of the special yields on the board you wish to cover. At the moment when you connect them, the brown yield tiles give you a special yield that depends on the progress you have made so far in a specific field: Now place the remaining brown yield tiles as well as all other yield tiles face up on the buildings of the same color on the gameboard. You may get them during the game to enhance the special yield you can get from your province board. The white, yellow, and red yield tiles give you special yields as follows: Attention! Always score for the province tile first before you take the special yield. You may not move or cover yield tiles already placed on the board. There are 2 ways to obtain additional yield tiles during the game: a) When you are at the dancer Every time you place a worker at the dancer and give up one value-2 die of any color, you may take 2 dice of your choice from the supply and choose any yield tile. You immediately put this tile face up on an (as yet) unoccupied space of the corresponding color on your province board. Different from the basic game, here you earn the yield not immediately but only when you have connected the yield tile to a road on your province board. b) When you have fewer active workers than other players If, for example, you have a total of 4 active workers, but at least one of the other players already has 5 workers at his disposal, you get 1 yield tile in the fifth stage of the current round if it were your turn to place a worker but you don\u2019t have any left. You immediately decide on which unoccupied space of your board you want to place the new yield tile (face up and color-matching). Navaratnas Version Dice (1 or 2 of specific colors or of your choice)Money Karma (1 or 2)1 building upgrade 1 boat move (onto the next unoccupied river space) 1 fame point for each tile in your province that has at least 1 market 2 fame points for each bend that you have built in your province1 money per building in your province 2 money for each yield tile you have connected1 fame point for each active worker you have1 fame point for every 3 river spaces you have advanced so far (the starting space doesn\u2019t count) 2 money per upgrade you have made so far 22The river tiles: Take as many dice of any colors from the supply as you have karma at this moment (e.g., 3 dice of the same color or of different colors, if your karma is at level 3). Take 3 dice, one of each color shown.", "Take the palace action, depending on the character shown (see page 18, The \u201cChambers\u201c). Conduct a market scoring for goods of one kind. Collect the money for up to 3 markets of one type in your province, for which you do not have to pay an extra die (see p.", "17, explanation of the markets). Advance up to 3 unoccupied spaces on the river and collect the earnings of the space where you stop.If at least one other player even has 2 more active workers than you, you take another yield tile and place it as if it were your turn to place a worker but you can\u2019t place any for the second time. Attention!", "You may only take yield tiles in a color for which you still have space available on your board. You may also refrain from taking a yield tile. For Mixed Player Groups For advanced players who play with a group that includes beginners, it is also possible to play with handicaps. In this case, the advanced players use the Navaratnas side of theirboard and the back of their Kali statue, whereas the beginners use the basicside of their board and the front of their Kali statue. You can have up to 5 workers. The yellow, red, and brown yield tiles stay in the box. You play according to the basic rules and use only the white yield tiles for which you get a yield only at the dancer (as in the basic game) to use immediately. Modify river spaces using river tiles For this version, you add the 8 river tiles to the game. They modify the river earnings. At the beginning of the game, shuffle the river tiles face down. Roll a die, count the spaces, beginning with the first space after the starting space, draw the first tile blindly and place it face up on the corresponding river space. For example, if you roll a \u201c2,\u201c you place the first river tile on the second space and, in doing so, replace the 2 karma shown there. Roll again, count the next spaces and place a tile until either you run out of tiles or the river ends. The final space may never be covered by a river tile.", "Return remaining river tiles to the game box. The Ganga Module 23Mogul empire (1526-1858) \u2013 The Mogul empire was a great empire that developed in the Indus-Ganges plain in North India. At the peak of its power (17th century), it comprised almost the entire India (as we know it today) and some parts of Afghanistan. In 1858, the remaining part of the empire was occupied by the British and ceased to exist. A rich heritage of architecture, painting, and poetry shaped by Persian and Indian artists have been preserved to the present day. The empire was named after its rulers, the Great Moguls. Great Mogul \u2013 Also called \u2019Mogul\u2019 or \u2019Mogul Emperor.\u2019 The name probably came to Europe through the Portuguese (in Portuguese, Gr\u00e3o Mogol ) who were the dominating power in the Indian Ocean territory at that time. The word Mogul is derived from the Persian mughul , which means \u2019Mongol,\u2019 referring to the fact that some Mogul\u2019s ancestor had married into the clan of Genghis Khan. The most prominent Mogul ruler in history was Akbar the Great (reign: 1556-1605); he brought the empire to prosperity in military, political, and economic terms. Under Shah Jahan (reign: 1627-1658), the Mogul empire reached its cultural peak. At that time, the Taj Mahal, the Red Fort (Delhi), and the Shalimar Gardens in Lahore were established \u2013 all of them inscribed as UNESCO world heritage sites (in 1982, 2007, and 1981). This game symbolically deals with the era from Akbar to Shah Jahan. These are a few elements significant for the era of the Great Moguls or for the India of today that are showcased in the game: Kali \u2013 A Hindu goddess that represents destruction and renewal. Her destructive power, however, mainly targets demons and the injustice of the world. Popular belief is that she can grant wishes.(Blue) Peafowl \u2013 Since 1963, the blue peafowl has officially been ranked among the national animals of India (besides the Bengal tiger and the Ganges river dolphin). Originally, it came from the Indian subcontinent where it is considered a sacred animal since it gives warning of tigers and severe weather and kills (young) poisonous snakes, among other things. Whereas the western world often associates the peafowl not only with beauty but also with arrogance and vanity, Indians primarily consider it a symbol of regality and immortality. Therefore, peacock statues were prominently designed also on the throne of the Mogul emperors. Peacock Throne \u2013 The Peacock Throne was a throne chair decorated with an abundance of pearls, gold, and gems (more than 26,000) that was manufactured by order of Shah Jahan and inaugurated in 1635. The production took seven years and was said to have been twice as expensive as the construction of the Taj Mahal; this was considered very extravagant even for a Mogul emperor. Since the Red Fort (Delhi) was plundered in the 18 th century, the Peacock Throne has been presumed lost. Ashoka Pillar \u2013 The present coat of arms of India shows the adapted capital of an Ashoka pillar, the famous \u201cFour Lions of Sarnath.\u201d Erected around 250 BC under Ashoka, the Indian ruler at that time, who had numerous monumental pillars set up during his reign at many strategic places, such as border towns and trade routes. Their capitals were used to proclaim his edicts. Some of these then-numerous and widespread pillars have been preserved down to the present day. They are silent witnesses of the bygone Great Indian Empire whose cultural heritage has stood the test of time. Raja Man Singh I \u2013 Raja Man Singh I was an important commander of the imperial armed forces. As a governor of several provinces, he had forest areas cultivated for agricultural progress, commissioned a variety of palaces, forts, and temples to be built, and was even engaged as a city founder. Additionally, Man Singh I gained a high reputation for being a member of the Navaratnas, the \u201cNine Gems\u201d of Akbar, a small group of extraordinary personalities at the Mogul emperor\u2019s court.

Sort the province tiles by their colour and then again by their animal backs, flip them over so you have twelve stacks of face up tiles.Players will receive a Province board, a dice-holding Kali statue and tokens of their preferred colour. They will then need to place their relevant pieces on the board. Add the yield tokens onto the board too. Each player then takes one of each colour dice and rolls them, placing them on Kali.There are some mini expansions or game variants included in the box and set up can differ slightly when playing with those.There is a bit to sort out at the start of the game, but it doesn\u2019t take long. Gameplay In its simplest form Rajas of the Ganges is a race for points. A player will win the game if their wealth track which moves anti-clockwise crosses their fame track which moves clockwise, around the edge of the board.Although you will place workers on the board, most spaces cost a specific die to visit.The board is divided into different areas. The Chambers with the characters on, give different benefits depending on what dice you use. These vary from claiming the first player token, to gaining more dice, yield token bonuses or karma points. The Palace below allows you to convert, gain or reroll dice. The Quarry allows you to purchase a tile with specific coloured dice matching the cost on the tile. These are then placed on your Province board gaining fame and/or wealth. Once you have placed some tiles, the Market Place might be beneficial to sell wares matching the symbols on your tiles for money. Finally, the harbour allows to move up the river and grants handy one-off bonuses where your ship stops.Also on the board is a karma tracker, you can spend these to flip a die to its opposite side and tracks to increase the fame of constructing different buildings when you place tiles into your province with matching symbols.You will also unlock additional workers throughout the game which help ramp up the game time. Variants I have mostly played the vanilla version of Rajas of the Ganges, but I have tried the so-called Navaratnas version to mix it up. It changes things like the number of dice you can store, or upgrade the yield tokens to ones you can choose.", "It also flips your province board to the advanced side too. Whereas, the Ganga Module modifies the spaces on the river. There is also a variant that can help handicap more seasoned players against newcomers to the game. What it\u2019s like While you can and will spend wealth, dice are the most important resource of the game. Most spaces on the board will see you profiting from one die maximum. Although the game tricks you into thinking you get two dice from some spaces, you will have paid a die to activate that space. Dice are important because you will need them for almost every square on the board or to build tiles on your personal Province board. With tiles often costing a couple of dice, the challenge of keeping your dice supply high is tricky.What I have always admired in Rajas of the Ganges is how beautifully balanced the pip values are. Throughout the course of the game you will find yourself ebbing and flowing between wanting higher and lower value dice. Generally the board is better with lower pip values, but the better building tiles tend to be a higher cost and thus higher rolls are beneficial. Of course rolling dice does add an element of luck. There are times you are hoping to see a certain roll and may or may not see it. More often than not however, there are ways to utilise most rolls, they just may not be as optimum as you would like.The worker placement is tight too, with many areas having just one space. Competition for these can be high, and you will find yourself looking at what dice the other players have before deciding where your attention should focus. Stealing the first player token can be more advantageous than in some other games. Table Presence The board is one of the busiest you will see. It is a bombardment on the visual senses and a little daunting.", "I like it now and it all makes sense, but I remember when I first saw it, I was like\u2026 woah that\u2019s a lot! Bearing in mind it was released in 2017, for me the styling feels more dated than that. I almost feel like I shouldn\u2019t like it as much as I do!The wooden components are all fine, as is the cardboard first player token. The tiles for the province board match the overall artwork nicely. I really like the backs of these tiles and I sometimes wish this palette was used more throughout the game.The dice are satisfyingly chunky without being over the top. They are good translucent colours too. I\u2019m a big fan of these D6s.When you are done playing, it all packs away nicely in the plastic insert. Rulebook There is a little ambiguity around the \u2018Master Builder\u2019 action whereby you can overlay a tile on top of a previously laid one. In the English rules it states you do not get the yield bonuses again, suggesting if it hadn\u2019t been previously activated you would get the bonus. The German rules state: \u201cDu erh\u00e4ltst beim \u00dcberbauen nie Sonderertr\u00e4ge\u201d which translates as \u201cYou never receive special yields when overbuilding\u201d which seems more explicit. Bearing in mind it was a German game from a German publisher, that\u2019s how I play it. I rarely use the Master Builder anyway!Otherwise the rulebook is pretty good, albeit just as busy as the board! I haven\u2019t compared and contrasted all the English and German text, so maybe there are other parts I\u2019m playing wrong.", "Perhaps I should caveat that this is a review of the English rulebook version! Final thoughts on Rajas of the Ganges There are some games that I will never part with and that I will always jump at the opportunity to play. Rajas of the Ganges is one of those games. I adore the worker placement and race to trigger the end of the game. While you may feel like you are in a Paula Abdul song, permanently taking two steps forward and then one step back, progress is made and the game ramps up in a really good way as the finish line draws in.Dice in games can be a put-off for many, but there is enough options to compensate for not getting ideal rolls. They might still frustrate and force you to adapt to secondary options, the nice thing is this board game gives plenty of ways to utilise your rolls and slightly mitigate them. The worker placement can be equally frustrating when someone steals the spot you were about to claim. For me, this adds to the strategy of the game, rather than deter me from enjoying it.Rajas of the Ganges is an excellent game at all player counts. If you get the opportunity, I whole-heartedly recommend you trying it!", "Title: Mechanics Description: Rajas of the Ganges is a worker placement game in which players must accumulate prestige and wealth in order to trigger the end of the game and be declared the winner. Each of these two elements are accumulated on a track that progresses in opposite directions, so that the game ends when one of the players manages to have their markers cross on the board.", "Most of the actions will be aimed at obtaining resources, represented by dice, to later use them in other actions, the main one being building, which will allow us to place tiles with markets (providing coins) and buildings (providing prestige) on our personal board. On this board, we can also activate a series of rewards if we manage to connect them to our palace (in one of the squares) through the paths shown on the previous tiles. Title: Mechanics Subtitle: Basic Concepts Description: Let's start with the Main Board: List: # Within the same framework we find two tracks, the prestige points track (which starts in the lower right corner and progresses clockwise) and the money track (which starts in the lower right corner and progresses counter-clockwise). In both tracks we find certain bonuses, among which is the one to obtain new workers. # In the upper left area we find the karma track (which we will talk about later), with four rows. # On the right side we find the prestige tracks for the construction of the four types of buildings, with three columns each. # In the left area we find the palace, with various actions. # In the central area we find the quarry, the market and the port, with more actions available. # Finally, surrounding the three previous sections we find the river, composed of a series of boxes with different benefits each. Money Markers will progress on the money track. These markers will fluctuate on this track as money will be one of the resources to be managed during the game. Upon reaching a bonus space, the player will receive the benefit instantly. Prestige Markers will progress clockwise on the prestige track. Prestige points, unlike money, are automatically consolidated and cannot be lost in any way during the game. Upon reaching a bonus space, the player will receive the benefit instantly. Since the marker on the money track can reach a certain position and then move back, there are profit markers that determine which is the next profitable box that has not yet been reached. The main mechanic of the game will be the placement of Workers. Each player will have a number of pawns (3 initially) that can be placed in various actions on the board. These actions can have a cost consisting of money or resources, which must be delivered at the moment of placing the pawn. The benefits of the action will be received instantly. Resources are represented by 6-sided dice (with values from 1 to 6) and four colors. These resources will be used, basically, to feed certain actions and build tiles, the value of each of these dice being very important, since there will be actions that require offering or exceeding a specific value and/or a specific color. Each time a player obtains a resource, he must roll the corresponding die to assign it a value. The number of resources a player can store is limited by the capacity of their Statue of the Goddess Kali, which can hold one die in each of its arms. The statue has two sides, one with two more spaces than the other. If a player receives more resources than they can store, they must return the excess to the reserve. The tiles contain the roads and buildings that we can establish in our province. These tiles are separated into 12 stacks (3 types of tiles in the 4 colours), so that there will always be 12 available to acquire. These tiles show roads that can connect 2, 3 or all 4 sides, an acquisition cost in the upper left corner (a die of the colour associated with the tile with a numerical value). These tiles will show two types of elements: List: # Markets: which provide coins and have an associated commodity (tea, silks or spices) # Buildings: one of four existing types and that provide prestige points depending on the player's level in that type of building. The Marker Cubes will be used primarily to indicate the level of prestige a player gains by placing a tile with one or more buildings. A fifth cube is left over and will be used to mark the karma level. This concept will allow us to alter the value of the resource dice, since for one karma point (up to 3 can be stored), we can flip a die to its opposite side (which added to the current side equals 7). The tiles are placed on the Province Board that each player will have in his playing area. These boards show 16 squares distributed in 4 rows and 5 columns (the 3 squares in the upper corners are cut out, and the central squares in the first and last row are blocked). The first one shows the player's palace, from which three paths start to which the tiles must connect. And the one in the bottom row shows a series of bonuses, which are also present on the edge of the board. The basic rule when placing a tile is that it must be connected by some path to the palace (even if there are paths that are blocked). Additionally, when we manage to connect one of the bonuses to the castle, we will receive the benefit immediately. These benefits can be increased by means of Production Tokens, in four colours. Whenever we receive one of these tokens, we will place it on one of the spaces on the board, although they will not be activated retroactively, that is, if the space is adjacent to a square with a tile already placed, we will not be able to overlap the previous benefit with the new one and receive it. That space will no longer be available for bonuses. Finally, each player will have a Boat that will move along the Ganges. The river displays a series of stages with different benefits. When a player advances along the river, he will receive the benefit of the space where his movement ends. With the exception of the starting space and the ending space, only one Boat can remain on a space, so when progressing, occupied spaces will not be taken into account when spending advancement points (they will be skipped). This is enough for us. Title: Mechanics Subtitle: Game Preparation Description: List: # The board is unfolded with the side corresponding to the number of players. In 3-player games, tiles are placed on the first building space and the last space in the first row of the river action. # In 3-player games, tiles are placed on the first building space and the last space in the first row of the river action. # A general reserve is formed with the resource dice. # 12 stacks of tiles are formed by separating them by color and type.

Title: Mechanics Subtitle: Game Development Description: A game of Rajas of the Ganges consists of an indeterminate number of rounds until the end condition is met. Each round, players take turns (starting with the starting player and continuing clockwise) in which they simply place one of their available workers on a free action on the board. If the action has a cost in resources or money, the player must be able to bear that cost in order to execute the action. The available actions are: List: # Quarry: Spaces in this area allow building tiles. The player must pay the money indicated on the space in addition to any resource dice whose sum equals or exceeds the value indicated on the tile he wishes to build. He then takes the tile and legally places it on his province board (connecting it to the palace by some path), receiving the benefits of the symbols that connect to the palace. If the tile shows markets, the player receives the money indicated on them. If the tile shows buildings, the player receives for each of them as many victory points as his marker for that type of building on the main board indicates. # Market: These are stocks that provide money. There are two types: Fixed Goods: A resource of any color is returned and as many markets of the corresponding type built in the province are activated as the value of the resource used (all markets will be activated if the value is equal to or greater than the number of markets). Various Merchandise: up to 3 markets are activated, one of each type of merchandise, but without the need to use any resources. # Fixed Commodity: A resource of any color is returned and as many markets of the corresponding type built in the province are activated as the value of the resource used (all markets will be activated if the value is equal to or greater than the number of markets). # Various Merchandise: up to 3 markets are activated, one of each type of merchandise, but without the need to use any resources. # Port: Activated by paying the cost in coins and returning a resource with a value between 1 and 3 of any color. The player will advance his ship as many spaces as he wishes (at least one and maximum the value of the die given) and will receive the benefit indicated on the space where he stopped his movement. Occupied spaces are not taken into account when using advancement points (they are skipped). # Palace: Great Mogul: For a resource value of 1 of any color, you can gain 2 prestige points and be the starting player in the next round (take the elephant marker). Dancer: For a resource value of 2 of any color, it provides 2 resources of the color the player chooses (which he will roll and place on his statue) and 1 bonus tile that is placed on the board. Yogi: For a resource value of 3 of any color provides 2 karma points and 1 resource of any color. Raja Man Sigh: For a resource value of 4 of any color provides an advancement in one type of building and 2 coins. Master Builder: For a resource value of 5, you can build a tile from the available tiles on top of another tile already on the board, paying only the difference between the value of the new tile and the one to be overlapped in resources of the color of the new tile (the color of the overlapping tile is irrelevant). Tiles on the board cannot be left unconnected, and you do not receive the bonuses of a space a second time. Portuguese: For a resource value of 6, you can advance exactly 6 spaces on the river, receiving the benefit of the last space. If there are less than 6 spaces left to reach the last space, this action cannot be used. # Great Mogul: For a resource value of 1 of any color, you can obtain 2 prestige points and be the starting player in the next round (take the elephant marker). # Dancer: For a resource value of 2 of any color, it provides 2 resources of the color the player chooses (which he will roll and place on his statue) and 1 bonus tile that is placed on the board. # Yogi: For a resource of value 3 of any color provides 2 karma points and 1 resource of any color. # Raja Man Sigh: For a resource value of 4 of any color provides an advancement in one type of building and 2 coins. # Master Builder: For a resource value of 5, you can build a tile from the available tiles on top of another tile already on the board, paying only the difference between the value of the new tile and the one to be overlapped in resources of the color of the new tile (the color of the overlapping tile is irrelevant). Tiles on the board cannot be left unconnected, and the bonuses of a space are not received a second time. # Portuguese: For a resource value of 6, you can advance exactly 6 spaces on the river, receiving the benefit of the last space. If there are less than 6 spaces left to reach the last space, this action cannot be used. # Balconies: For 1 blue/orange/purple/green resource you receive 2 orange/purple/green/blue resources. # Terrace: The player receives a resource of the corresponding color. # Outdoor Terrace: The player receives 2 coins and may re-roll as many dice as he wants from his reserve. The round ends when all players have used all their pawns. If there are players with fewer pawns, for each turn they would have to take in the round to have the same number as everyone else, they will draw a bonus tile which they will place on their board. After this, the players take back their pawns and a new round begins. Title: Mechanics Subtitle: End of the Game Description: The final round of the game is triggered when a player's prestige and money markers cross during his turn. The round is completed when all players have had the same number of turns. If only one player has managed to cross their markers, they are the winners. If several players achieve this feat, the winner is the one who has the most prestige points between them and the money marker. If there is still a tie, the winner is the one who first managed to cross their markers. Title: Mechanics Subtitle: Variants Description: List: # Simplified Gameplay: The game is played with the reverse side of the province boards and the Kali goddess board (with 2 more spaces for resources) and only the white bonus tiles are used (which provide immediate benefits when drawn and then discarded later). Players can only choose to get 2 additional workers (when they get the fifth, the sixth one still on the board is returned to the box). # Ganga Module: allows you to vary the benefits of the river. Mix the 8 river tiles and roll a die several times to replace the squares on the board with the tokens. For each roll, count how many free squares there are from the starting square or the last covered square. The last river space cannot be covered. When a tile can no longer be placed because it is out of range, it and any remaining tiles are returned to the box. Title: Personal Opinion Description: Today we're going to analyze the game presented by the Brand couple at the Essen Fair in 2017. One of the games that was announced the earliest and about which we started receiving information with some consistency (not like many others that a few days before the start of the fair we only knew the name). A game that, curiously, uses the same setting as Agra (here is its long review), one of the titles that raised the most expectations before, during and after that same fair. We won't say that India was the hot topic, but the coincidence is, at the very least, striking. Let's see how it behaves on the table. The Brand brothers touched the sky with a great design like La Villa (here is their long review) and, until last year, they had not managed to come close to that success in terms of impact and quality. It was not until 2016 when they managed to return to the covers of the gaming media with their particular series of Escape Rooms, Exit, winning the Spiel des Jahres and launching quite a few scenarios.", "In 2017 they returned to the field of medium-weight Eurogames with an apparently very conventional design. In Rajas of the Ganges we seek to be the Raja or Rani with the greatest wealth and prestige. To do this we will have to develop the province surrounding our palace. How? Through a main mechanic of placing workers with which we will obtain resources with which to obtain tiles that will contain the roads, markets and buildings that will shape our domains. Sounds uninspiring, right?", "I won't tell you anything. Rajas of the Ganges doesn't break new ground, but it works well enough to make every game we play quite enjoyable. And this is mainly due to one factor that I'll talk about later.", "But first, let's focus on the mechanics. Worker placement couldn't be more standard. Each player has a number of pawns that they place in alternating turns on the different action spaces, receiving the associated benefit immediately and leaving the action blocked until the end of the round. The most notable thing in this regard is that the action spaces have variable costs, and there may be cases where there are actions that, even if available, we cannot activate because we do not have the necessary elements in our personal reserve. On the other hand, we have a tile placement that draws directly from the king of kings in this genre, Carcassonne (here is its long review). Players must shape their province by placing tiles that show a series of roads and, around these, markets and buildings, which will provide us with money and prestige. The only rule that must be followed is that the paths of the tiles must be connected to the palace by some route, although cutting roads is allowed (not respecting the drawings), as long as there is an alternative route to reach the tile. This is something we already saw in Isle of Skye (here is its long review) and that will drive out those who consider what Alexander Pfister did in the game on the Scottish island a sacrilege. These two core mechanics dominate the development of Rajas of the Ganges, which, as we have already said, do not seem particularly striking at first glance. However, the design includes two details that give it a certain freshness.", "The first of these is the shape given to the resources, which are dice instead of the classic cubes or tokens. These dice will obviously be rolled to determine their value (between 1 and 6), restricting their possibilities. These resources will have two main purposes. The first will be to feed some of the actions. Some will ask for specific values (or an acceptable range), while others will require a specific color from the four possible. Obviously, having given the game, chance makes an important appearance, since, if we want to carry out any of the actions that require a specific value and the fates refuse to grant it to us, we can pray as much as we know that it will be impossible for us to activate said actions. Fortunately, being so direct, we do not particularly notice the setbacks of the goddess of fortune, since the important end for the resources will be the purchase of tiles. And in this case, exact values are not required, our only concern being to reach the minimum value indicated on the tile we are looking for.", "The second and perhaps most important detail is the trigger for the end of the game. Rajas of the Ganges is presented to us as a race to be the first to accumulate enough prestige and money so that the markers on both tracks intersect, since each one, the prestige track and the money track, progress in opposite directions. To give it more flavor, money is also a resource, so it will be a fluctuating track, with the markers advancing and retreating in each round, while the prestige points are consolidated and progress can only be made in a single direction. To prevent players from finding it particularly attractive to enhance only one of the two tracks, certain aspects have been modulated that \"force\" players to develop relatively evenly. In other words, I think it is difficult for a player to achieve victory by accumulating money or fame alone. First, because money is vital to activate the main actions, which would automatically rule out the strategy of accumulating mainly prestige points. But the opposite is true, since prestige points have a double value. If you look at the tracks, the width of a prestige point square occupies exactly 2 squares of the money track. Thus, a victory point is equivalent to 2 coins when looking for the crossing of the markers. The last addition to encourage development on both tracks is the presence of incentives for reaching certain squares, especially obtaining new workers. Falling behind in this aspect can be fatal. Thus, the game becomes an exercise in optimization to see who is able to convert their actions and resources into the greatest amount of prestige points and coins. This is where the differential element comes in, in addition to the order in which the tiles appear. I am referring to the river track, which works as a kind of string of fairly powerful bonuses that will allow players to accelerate somewhat, as well as allowing them to obtain one of the additional workers during the game. In addition, these are actions that require low values to make use of those dice that are left behind. You have to be careful because the temptation to go all out for that worker thanks to the Portuguese action can cause us to lose important bonuses along the way. It is also very interesting to use the bonus tiles that we acquire when filling the edge of our province board, since they will determine, in a certain way, the tiles that we will acquire, beyond looking for specific markets and buildings. Especially important are the scoring bonus tiles (the brown ones), since they usually provide a significant injection of prestige points. In fact, it is quite common for the game to end thanks to the connection of some of these bonuses. As a final interesting detail to highlight, the use of karma as an element to alleviate the influence of chance. With these points we can rotate the dice to the parallel side of the current value. It may seem insufficient, but when one considers that the tiles whose value is higher than 6 necessarily require 2 dice, it is easy to get the combination of dice needed. Also very interesting is the use of actions that provide 2 resources in exchange for one, since both dice are rolled and received of the same color, so it is more than likely to be able to acquire at least one of the available tiles. Perhaps the greatest virtue of the design is its excellent pace of play, since unlike most worker and/or tile-placement games, upkeep is usually relatively cumbersome. But in this case, all you have to do at the end of the round is remove your pawns and start over. There is no time to breathe. It is also necessary to point out that, due to the relative simplicity of the objective and the way to achieve it, some players may find the pattern of action somewhat repetitive, depending on the situation on the board (available tiles, occupied spaces, resources in the personal reserve, etc.) and the decision-making process. But, in essence, it will take us almost an hour to place workers to obtain resources to use to get tiles. The fun of the game will be to obtain those that interest us the most in the most effective way possible to open a gap. If you read the manual, you will see that the basic game is explained first and then the additional modules are included. I consider it essential to play directly with the first module that includes the rest of the bonus tokens and all the workers. The \"basic\" mode for a first game with inexperienced players may not be bad to relax the conceptual load a bit. But with a minimum background, it is best to play directly with the first module that completes the design. It is inevitable to compare the game we are dealing with today with the most famous design by the Brand brothers. Personally, I prefer The Village, which I think is a game with more depth and alternatives (as well as greater stress). However, as both are medium-weight, The Village has the problem that, in the first game, the explanation involves too many concepts and some are relatively confusing, such as what may seem like a worker placement (when it is not), and the functioning of each area of the village. Rajas of the Ganges is much more to the point, although this implies less depth. For players who have been in the hobby for years and have a significant background, Rajas of the Ganges will not break any molds. But I do think it is a very good recommendation for those who are not yet fed up with so many worker placement games. Scalability is the usual thing in this type of game. The board is adjusted, allowing for a greater or lesser amount of actions depending on the participants. It is true that with two players there is a little less tension since the available tiles are the same and the number of contenders is not the same, so the margin for managing resources is increased. But the tension of the race is the same. The only bad thing is that, with two players, if one player gains enough of an advantage, it is possible that the rest of the game will be less interesting since it will be difficult for the rival to catch up with him. Replayability may be, perhaps, its biggest weakness. It is a game with not too many avenues to explore and in just a few games it will be clear how to act, with the responsibility of the players maintaining the competitive tension, evaluating the available options (which are not many) and choosing the appropriate actions at each moment. Fortunately, the great pace of the game already mentioned favors the game's release, since it is a pleasant worker placement game and the game is finished in less than an hour. As for production, HUCH & friends! offers us standard qualities, where the most notable thing is the large number of translucent dice in unusual colours such as violet, orange, turquoise blue, although, in my case, there are dice that are not completely well formed, showing certain imperfections that, although they do not affect the game experience, denote a lack of care in production. The wooden elements are standard, highlighting the workers' pawns with an original shape (with turban and slippers). The cardboard used in boards and tiles is also of a standard thickness, with adequate rigidity and can be easily punched out without any problems. Finally, the rules are structured in a somewhat confusing way, and important concepts such as receiving benefits when placing a tile are somewhat hidden. With careful reading, nothing should escape us, but it is one of those manuals in which solving a specific doubt is not as simple as it might seem because it is difficult to find the specific section where the concept in question is referred to.", "In terms of visuals, we have Mr.", "Lohausen again at the brushes in a somewhat overloaded work. When one sees photos of the game displayed on the table, it is impossible not to squint to distinguish the different elements. It is true that during the game the design is relatively clear and the symbology hardly leaves room for doubt. But it is not pleasing to the eye. Far from the harmony of The Villa or The Travels of Marco Polo.", "And we're closing. Rajas of the Ganges is a good medium-weight tile and worker placement game that stands out for its peculiar game-ending system (getting two tracks that progress in opposite directions to cross as quickly as possible), the use of dice as resources and their value modulating the weight of the dice, and, above all, a spectacular game pace that barely leaves time to breathe. It perfectly fulfills its function and the games are very enjoyable.", "Perhaps the only notable problem with the design is that it can be relatively repetitive and that when a player gains an advantage it is difficult to snatch victory from them. But as I said, it is very entertaining and as a medium-weight game it fulfills its purpose perfectly. For all these reasons I give it a..."], "uris": null, "data": null, "metadatas": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null], "included": ["documents", "metadatas"]}
